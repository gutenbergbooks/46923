<p class='drop-capa c006'    >Legend is not history; but in legend we find embodied
historical truths, manners and customs of past ages, beliefs
and superstitions otherwise long forgotten, of which history itself
takes no account. Legend has preserved for us, maybe in
romantic dress, maybe under altered names and circumstances,
stirring pictures of heroes and heroines, who once have lived and
suffered, fought and conquered, or have faced death with trustful
courage; pictures, too, of men of equal prowess, as strong in evil
as in might, who, victorious for a time, have yet ever met a stronger
power than theirs, stronger in virtue, stronger in might.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we write, the shadowy forms of terrific Alboin raising aloft
his goblet fashioned from royal skull; the noble Siegfried with
his loved Chriemhild and the jealous Brunhild; brave King
Dietrich; the gentle, patient Gudrun and her beauteous mother
Hilde, all flit before the mind, framing themselves into a vivid
picture, such as must have lived in the imagination of our early
forefathers, stirring them on to noble actions, restraining them
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
from evil working. Thus has good in all ages fought against ill,
and all races of men have sung its victory in strains but slightly
varying. And so will it ever fight, no matter how our more
elaborate ideas of what is good or evil may vary: the nation
always glorifies the great and noble according to its own unreasoning
reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>This volume contains the principal hero-lays of the six great
epic cycles of the Teutonic Middle Ages, and to them we have
added the great mythical Carolingian cycle, which centred round
the persons of Charlemagne and his heroes. The latter is mostly
of Romance origin, and was composed by court troubadours for
the delight of the royal palace, wherefore it never became the
true inheritance of the masses. Beside these French poems,
stand the Breton ones of King Arthur and his Knights of the
Round Table, which later on took up the legend of the Holy
Grail into their very heart, and at this period found their way to
Germany, where they met with a more romantic and poetic treatment
at the hands of the court minnesingers. But these foreign
importations never found a true home amongst the German
people; they never became <em>popular</em>. The native hero-lays on
the other hand, even though less beautiful in conception and in
form, lived on through centuries, and even to this day exist,
though disguised and degraded. For in the market-places of
Germany, and at the few old English fairs that yet remain,
the pedlar bookseller gives in exchange for the farthing piece
printed versions of many of these old legendary tales: Siegfried’s
battle with the Dragon, the Rose-garden, Alberic and Elbegast’s
adventures, and other wondrous histories of Teutonic epical
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
origin. But this literature is fast dying out, if, indeed, it may not
by this time be said to be already dead. In Iceland, however, and
in the Faroe Isles, tradition still holds her throne unconquered.
She yet sings to the listening greybeards, to the men and women,
and to the growing youth, of Odin and his mighty rule, of Hönir
and the wicked Loki, of Thor and Frey, and Freya Queen of
Heaven, of the Fenris-wolf and the Midgard-serpent. In the
long winter nights she still tells of bold Sigurd’s (Siegfried)
deeds and battles, of Gudrun’s faithful love and dumb grief
beside the body of her lord, of Gunnar’s marvellous harping in the
garden of snakes, and the listeners hold it all in their memory,
that they may sing and tell it to their children and their children’s
children. And so do they cherish the time-old legends of their
fathers, that the ardent youth may still be heard to adjure his
bride to love him “with the love of Gudrun,” the master revile his
dishonest workmen as “false as Regin” (the evil dwarf), and the
old men to shake their heads and say of the daring lad, that he is
“a true descendant of the Wolsings.” At the dance, Sigurd-songs
are yet sung, at Christmastide a grotesque Fafnir takes his part
in the mummery. Thus old German tradition in her wane has
found an asylum, perhaps a last resting-place, in the far North,
driven from their first home by strangers, the myths of Greece and
Rome. Every schoolboy can tell of Zeus and Hera, of Achilles
and Odysseus, every schoolgirl of the golden apples of the
Hesperides, of Helen, of Penelope; yet to how many of our older
folks, even, are the grand forms of Siegfried, Chriemhild, and
Brunhild more than mere names?</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that a tendency is now springing up in England and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
in Germany once more to enquire into these old tales, nay beliefs,
of our common ancestry. It is true that we have a Morris and
they a Wagner; but we should wish to see the people of both
nations take a more general interest in a subject of such intrinsic
worth to them, their long-forgotten heritage. It is not the history
of class-books that they will find in it—it is that of their fathers’
manners and customs, of their joys and sufferings, their games and
occupations, festivals and religious observances, battles, victories
and defeats, their virtues and their crimes. Such is the golden
field that lies beneath our feet, which, unheeded, we have let lie
fallow, till it has almost faded from memory.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a previous volume, <cite>Asgard and the Gods, the Tales and
Traditions of our Northern Ancestors</cite>, we have endeavoured to
give an account of the <em>religion</em> of our ancient Norse parents. In
this volume we are occupied with their <em>legendary lore</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>To what extent these legends formed a part of their religion
proper it is impossible for us now to say. Of later origin and
more poetic treatment, they stood in a similar position toward the
old Teutons as the later Greek heroic legend stood to the Greeks
of history. Some say, and the learned Grimm amongst them,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
that the heroes were historical men raised to the dignity of gods,
others that they were humanized gods themselves; but may be
neither theory is exactly true, though both contain a portion of
the truth. In the hero-legends we certainly find heroes possessed
of the distinctive attributes of certain gods, and we are tempted
to add others to their characters, but we consider that these divine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
qualities were looked upon rather as divine <em>gifts</em> of the gods and
did not thereby exactly deify the recipients. It was similar with
the Greeks, and perhaps with all nations at a stage when their
heroes really formed an essential element in their belief. The
gods were never human heroes, the heroes never became gods,
though each approached the other so nearly that we are often
misled into assuming that they were identical.</p>

<h3 id='p1c1s1'>I<br />
<span class='sc'>ALBOIN and ROSAMUND.</span></h3>

<p class='center'><span class='sc'>Alboin.</span></p>

<p class="dc1">Untroubled by the conscientious
scruples of the historian, the
poet throws the glamour of his genius over the events he
relates, when taking for his theme the great deeds of the past,
he strives to make them live in the hearts of his hearers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of Alboin and Rosamund has a strictly historical
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
foundation, although many poetic liberties have been taken with
it. For instance, it is contrary to fact that the heroes of this and
the following tale were predecessors of Theoderic, for Alboin did
not march into Italy at the head of his Langobards until the year
568 <span class='sc'>A.D.</span>, whereas Theoderic died in 526, and his Gothic empire
was destroyed in 553. Nevertheless we give the stories in their
poetical order, as the natural connection between them is thus
kept up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Germanic Gepidæ and Langobards and the Asiatic Avars
were inhabitants of Pannonia (<i>i.e.</i> Hungary and the neighbouring
provinces) at the time this story begins. War and hunting were
the occupations of the freemen, while the serfs tended the flocks
and herds, and cultivated the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it happened that Alboin, son of the Langobardian ruler
Audoin, conquered and slew a son of Thurisind, king of the
Gepidæ, in fair fight. He then took possession of the armour
of his vanquished foe, and bore it in his arms to his father’s hall,
just as the warriors of his race were assembling there to hold
high festival. He would have joined them, but his father forbade
him, saying that it had always been held by the sages of the olden
time, that no prince was worthy to sit at the table of heroes until
he had been given a suit of mail by some foreign king. The
young man snatched up his battle axe, but remembering in time
that it was his father who stood before him, turned and left the
hall. He mounted his charger, and set out with his train for the
land of the Gepidæ. He arrived at the royal stronghold when
King Thurisind was feasting with the princes of his people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alboin approached the king, and placing himself under protection
of the laws of hospitality, begged that he might be
furnished with a suit of armour forthwith. The Gepidæ were
displeased with the boldness of his manner, but Thurisind received
him kindly, and gave him a seat at his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
Many beakers were drunk, and the conversation at table grew
more and more unfriendly, for Künemund, the king’s eldest son,
was angry and jealous at a stranger being given his place beside
the king. To prevent further disagreement, Thurisind sent for the
minstrels to come and enliven the company.</p>

<p class='c007'>They came. They sang the glorious deeds of their forefathers,
and especially those done by Aldarich, who destroyed the power
of the Huns. Lastly, they called upon the young men before
them to follow in the footsteps of their ancestors, careless whether
Fortune rewarded their efforts or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Künemund when the song was ended, “Fortune is
blind and throws her favours at the feet of mean-spirited creatures
with white bands round their knees, that make them look for
all the world like white-legged hacks, and every one knows it takes
a deal of beating to make them go!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Langobards always wore the white bands alluded to, so
they knew that the scornful words were directed against them.
Alboin’s blood was up in a moment. He started to his feet and
told Künemund to go to the place where he had fought his
brother, and there he would see how shrewdly the “white-legged
hacks” could kick.</p>

<p class='c007'>A tumult immediately arose, which was with difficulty calmed
by the old king, who then gave Alboin the armour he had craved,
and sent him away with his followers without loss of time, lest
worse should come of it, and the rights of hospitality be broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Alboin rode away he passed Rosamund, Künemund’s fair
little daughter, who was playing at shuttlecock with her maidens,
and as he passed he looked at her long and earnestly.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Rosamund.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Peace lasted between the Langobards and Gepidæ while the
old kings Audoin and Thurisind lived, but after their death a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
bloody feud broke out between the rival tribes. At length
Künemund and many of the noblest Gepidæ fell under the axes
of Alboin and his people. Upon which the Langobardian king
had his enemy’s skull set as a goblet in a silver rim, and used it
for drinking solemn toasts at the great feasts. Then he married
Rosamund, and she, poor soul, hated him as the murderer of
her father. She had to feign love, though she would willingly
have strangled her husband with her own hands. She bore her
lot as well as might be, all the while nursing the secret hope that
she might one day avenge her father’s death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alboin had no idea of the thoughts that filled his wife’s heart.
Intent on conquest, he crossed the Alps into Italy at the head
of his own people, of those Gepidæ who had followed the
fortunes of their princess, and of other adventurers who had joined
his train. This he did in response to an invitation from the
Roman general Narses, victor over the Ostrogoths, who feeling
himself slighted by the imperial court, had determined on vengeance.
Alboin carried all before him, and destroyed every town
and fortress that did not at once open its gates to receive him.
Pavia alone offered a long resistance. During his three years’
siege of that city, the Langobardian king made raids into the
neighbouring country and brought it under his rule. One warrior
alone was equal to him in prowess, and that was Peredeus, a giant,
who was said to possess the strength of twelve ordinary men. At
last the gates of Pavia opened, and Alboin, who had sworn to
put the inhabitants to fire and sword, rode in under the archway.
Just then his horse stumbled, and a priest exclaimed that this
was an omen that he should die a violent death if he kept his
word. The king believed the warning, forgave, and spared the
city.</p>

<div class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
<span class='sc'>The Regicide.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Alboin gave a great feast to his warriors, at which much of the
fiery wine of the south was consumed. The talk of the guests
was of the great deeds of Wodan, the god of battles, and how
he and Frigga had led their fathers to victory; then they spoke
of their own conquest of the Gepidæ and their victories in Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of this, Alboin, intoxicated with wine and pride,
commanded that the goblet made out of Künemund’s skull should
be brought, and turning to queen Rosamund desired her to pledge
him it. She hesitated. “Why,” he cried, “know you not,
Rosamund, that I love you more than aught in the world besides?
Show me now your love and obedience by doing what I bid you.”
She looked at him in silent entreaty, but her hesitation aroused
his anger. He raised his hand to strike her—and then—she lifted
her murdered father’s skull to her lips. None could tell whether
she drank or not, for, flinging the goblet on the table so violently
that the wine ran out, she said, “I have obeyed you, but you
have lost your wife.” Having uttered these words, she rose and
left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>A hoarse murmur of indignation passed from mouth to mouth,
for no one approved of what the king had done. And he,
suddenly sobered by his wife’s words and action, got up and
left the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alboin did not see Rosamund again until the following day,
when she went about her usual duties quietly. The insult seemed
to be forgiven and forgotten. But Rosamund could neither forgive
nor forget. She dreamed of vengeance. At last she persuaded
Helmigis, the king’s shield-bearer, to murder his master; but
when the moment for action came, he feared to do the deed.
So the queen turned to Peredeus for help, and by means of
flattery and sweet words brought him over to her side. One
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
evening he slipt into the king’s room and slew him. Before
Alboin’s death became known, the conspirators, of whom there
were many, got possession of the royal treasure, and hid it away
in a secret place. Soon after this, Rosamund announced her
betrothal to Helmigis, and named him as Alboin’s successor in
royal power.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nobles assembled to debate this point, and, after much
discussion, it was agreed by a large majority that the murderer
of the great Alboin was the last man who ought to succeed
him; that he should rather be punished for his crime. Hearing
how matters were going on in the council, the conspirators fled.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Retribution.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Guarded by her faithful Gepidæ, Rosamund and her accomplices
reached Ravenna in safety with the treasure they had carried
away with them. There they placed themselves under the protection
of Longinus, exarch or viceroy of the Eastern emperor.
They had not been there long when Longinus, having fallen
desperately in love with the fair widow, or with the wealth of
which she was possessed, asked Rosamund to marry him, and
she at once consented on condition that the viceroy freed her
from Helmigis, to whom she was already bound. Longinus gave
her a cup of wine mixed with a deadly poison, telling her to give
it to Helmigis the next time he complained of thirst. This she
did. Her victim drained half the goblet at a draught. The
poison was so strong that he immediately felt he was doomed,
and drawing his sword, forced her to finish what he had left.
Thus the murderers died, and their great treasure fell into the
hands of the Roman viceroy. But the story tells us that wealth
did not make him happy, and that it was the ultimate cause of
his death.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have still to learn what became of Peredeus, the giant. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
was so used to deeds of violence that he thought the murder of
Alboin a mere nothing. Placing himself at the head of a band
of Gepidæ, he set out for Constantinople and offered his services
to the emperor. His great strength gained him a high position
at court, and raised him in his master’s favour. As time went on
he became discontented with the treatment he received, thinking
it hardly consistent with the gratitude he deserved for his manifold
services. Some of his angry words were repeated to his master,
who determined to make him powerless to hurt the throne. One
night, when Peredeus was snoring off the effects of a drunken
orgy, a number of men crept into his room, chained him hand
and foot, and put out his eyes. His howls of pain were so terrible
that they made all in the palace and neighbourhood tremble.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blind giant showed himself quiet and obedient, so that his
guards ceased to fear him, but still they never took off his chains
until one evening he begged to be allowed to wrestle before the
emperor, maintaining that his strength was unabated. He was
led into the great hall, and there, amid the general applause,
proved himself as mighty an athlete as he had ever been. Suddenly
he heard the emperor’s voice, and dashing in that direction,
plunged a knife he had concealed about his person into the hearts
of two great officials of the court, whom he mistook for the
emperor. A few minutes more and he had fallen under the spears
of the body-guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, one by one, the murderers of Alboin all came to a violent
end, and the Langobards, for want of their leader, failed to gain
full possession of the fair southern land they had come to regard
as their own.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c007'>Occasionally their power was revived for a time by some able
king, such as Rotharis (636-52) the subject of the following
legend, till it was finally broken by Charlemagne the Frank (774).</p>

<p>KING ROTHER PUTS THE SHOES ON THE PRINCESS’S FEET.</p>

    <h3 id='p1c1s2'>II.<br />
    KING ROTHER (RUOTHER).</h3>

    <p class='center'><span class='sc'>The Twelve Messengers.</span></p>

<p class='dc2'>Bari is the name of an Italian
town which, small and unimportant
as it is now, was once a mighty sea-port. In those old
days the harbour was deep and large and full of ships, while in
the town itself were numerous palaces and houses surrounded
by gardens and orange-groves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here it was that the great and glorious King Rother, the
father of his people and the terror of his foes, held court amongst
the dukes, counts and nobles of the land. The race-course was
close to the sea, and there the young warriors were wont to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
congregate, to throw the spear and practise such sports as teach
agility, while the women and maidens looked on and distributed
prizes to the successful candidates for honour.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day King Rother was seated on his throne surrounded
by his counsellors, watching now the people, now the sports, and
now the restless waves that were beating against the shore.
There was a troubled look upon his face. Turning to his old
and faithful banner-bearer, Duke Berchther of Meran, who sat
beside him, “Look,” he said, “do you see how the waves raise
their foam-crowned heads high in the air, dash forward, and then
vanish without leaving a trace behind? The kings of the earth
resemble them in this, so indeed do all men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you say?” cried the duke. “Do you not hear how
many songs are sung in your praise? Know you not that such
songs live on from generation to generation, and that your name
and deeds will therefore be spoken of with admiration till the
end of time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is poor comfort,” replied the king. “What is the future
to me, when the present is so tame and joyless? A happy home
were better to me than the songs of which you speak. There
go your seven sons, bold Leupold at their head, their helmets
wreathed in token of victory. You live a second life in them,
and their love will sustain you in your old age. What good
is my throne to me? I have not wife nor child. I shall wither
like an old tree, or become the laughing-stock of children in my
age!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then why do you not marry?” asked the duke, laughing
heartily. “You are in your prime and a famous warrior. You
might pick and choose any one you liked for a wife, no one would
say you nay, from a simple maiden to a high-born princess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say that I am free to choose,” said Rother bitterly;
“kings are more fettered in their choice than other men. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
must marry in their own degree, or their children cannot succeed
them, and may even live to curse them. I have travelled in many
lands, but I have never yet seen the princess I could have wished
to make my wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay then, sire, if you are so hard to please,” returned
Berchther after a deep and thoughtful silence; “I think I know
of a lady who might suit you, if you are willing to risk your head
for her sake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king desiring further information, Berchther showed him
the portrait of a lovely girl, who, he said, was the daughter of
the Emperor of Constantinople. Rother could not take his eyes
off the picture, and exclaimed that she, and she alone, must be
his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very good, my lord,” said Berchther; “but that is a more
difficult matter to bring about than you think. I must explain
what I mean. The Emperor Constantine is so devoted to his
daughter that he will not part with her; and if any man—be
he count, duke or king—is bold enough to go and ask for her
hand, he at once orders his head to be cut off. And what is
the good of a headless wooer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think,” answered Rother, “that I shall meet with a better
reception than that. The emperor of the East will know how
to bear himself to the ruler of the West. But now call my
counsellors together, that I may tell them what I intend to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the council was assembled, the king told his ministers
the whole story, adding in conclusion that he intended to do his
wooing in person. They strongly dissuaded him from this, upon
the plea, that the king, being the chief of the state, had no right
to endanger its safety by risking his head unnecessarily. Rother
at last gave way, much against his will. The debate as to who
should go to Constantinople lasted a long time, for each man
felt that his head was of at least as much value to himself as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
king’s could possibly be to the state. Then Leupold, Berchther’s
brave son, rose with six of his brothers, and declared in their
name and his own that they were ready to go as soon as the
ships were fitted out for the journey; whereupon five noble
counts, emulating the valour of these seven, announced their
willingness to accompany them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Preparations were made for the departure of the twelve ambassadors,
and at last the day came on which they were to set sail.
Just before the anchors were lifted, the king came down to the
harbour, his gold-stringed harp in his hand, and sang them a
farewell song, so strangely sweet and stirring that it moved them
as Wodan’s songs used to move the hearts of their fathers in
the olden time. It seemed to them as though the god of battles
were calling on them to be up and doing. The music ceased;
and then Rother took leave of them, saying, “If ever you are in
need, and you hear that song, you may know that I am near
and will help you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hawsers were unloosed and the ship set sail. After a
voyage that lasted for days and weeks, the travellers sighted the
Golden Horn, the port of Constantinople; and as the sun was
rising over the city, they landed at the wharf. They dressed
themselves in velvet and heavy gold brocade, and cloaks trimmed
with ermine. Every one turned to gaze after them as they passed
up the street towards the palace. None knew who they were
or whence they came, but all thought they must be the ambassadors
of some mighty prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor was yet in bed, dreaming of the feasts and
carousals in which his heart delighted, when the empress awoke
him, and said, “Get up, Constantine; the messengers of a great
king have come to see you. They bring tidings of vast importance.
You must receive them with all due honour and respect.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the emperor was ready, he desired the ambassadors to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
be brought to him in the throne-room, where he received them
courteously. At first all went well. Constantine was pleased
that his friendship and alliance should be sought by the ruler
of the West, and expressed his delight in no scant terms; but
when Leupold went on to say that his royal master had also
commissioned him to ask in his name for the hand of the Princess
Oda, the emperor’s wrath knew no bounds, and he ordered his
guards to seize the “foreign hounds” and cast them into prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the guards had left the hall with the twelve ambassadors,
Constantine began to pace the floor, rubbing his hands, and
muttering, “Behead, drown, hang—which shall it be? Ah, it
were best to hang them. It would be a grand sight! Twelve
fine gentlemen in gorgeous raiment brought at once to the
gallows. St. Maurice grant that the wondrous spectacle may
bring us glory!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Constantine,” said the kindly empress, “beware what you
do. Is our beautiful daughter never to marry? Would it not
be a good thing to give her to King Rother, and let her rule
the West with him, as we the East? If you slay the messengers
he has sent, Rother will assuredly ally himself with the heathen
king of Desert-Babylon, and, with his help, seek your destruction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“St. Michael and his holy angels will protect us against the
might of the godless host of infidels,” replied the emperor
sanctimoniously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah,” said the prudent wife, “do not be too sure of that.
He has other things to do. He has to fight for the conversion
and salvation of the wild heathen tribes. Take my advice,
and keep Rother’s messengers as hostages, that our hands may
be strengthened when their king comes over the western sea
and demands them from us at the head of his army.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The counsel pleased the emperor, and he gave orders that
the prisoners should be well guarded.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
<span class='sc'>The Sailing of the Heroes.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The weeks and months rolled into a year, and still the ambassadors
did not return to Bari. Every heart was full of an
undefined dread. Had they perished at sea, or at the hands
of the cruel tyrant to whom they had been sent? None could
answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Berchther one day went to the king, and said, “Sire, my
heart is sad. I can bear my sorrow no longer. I had twelve
goodly sons. Helfrich, the eldest, was slain fighting the barbarians
near the Elbe in the far north. Seven have gone to Constantinople
in your service, and have never returned. I will go and see if
I can find them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must not go alone,” returned the king. “I will call a
meeting of the royal council, and ask my wise advisers what
were best to be done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a stormy discussion, in which weighty arguments were
often enforced with still weightier blows, it was determined to
follow the advice of the eldest counsellors. These aged and
reverend men were of opinion that it would be bad policy to
send an army against Constantinople; for were the messengers
still alive, the emperor would assuredly put them to death when
he found that Rother had appeared in the guise of an enemy.
It would be far better, they contended, to send a richly appointed
embassage, composed of good men and true, to spy
out the land, and see if it were not possible to save their
friends, and gain the hand of the princess at the same time.</p>

<p class='c007'>King Rother announced his intention of placing himself at
the head of the expedition, and as Berchther refused to be left
behind, Count Amelger of Tengeling was appointed regent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Preparations for their departure went on apace. Noble warriors
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
came from all parts of the kingdom to offer their services.
Among those accepted were twelve men who were so tall and
so heavy, that they could nowhere have found horses strong
enough to bear their weight. King Rother alone knew who they
were, and he received them as old and trusted friends. They
were Asprian (Osbern), chief of the Northern giants, and eleven
of his tallest men.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length all was ready, and the ship set sail amidst a blare
of trumpets. A fair wind filled the sheets, which were edged
with cloth of silver, and the vessels glided through the glassy
deep as if drawn by swans. The king stood high on the deck
of his galley: when he touched his harp and sang of woman’s
love and manly courage, the hearts of the heroes were fired
to deeds of daring. And the mermaids and dolphins dipt their
heads out of the waves, and played about the prows, and listened
to the lay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Rother called his chiefs about him, and told them that
he intended to go cunningly to work when he got to Constantinople.
He would introduce himself to the emperor as Dietrich,
a noble of King Rother’s country, who had been outlawed by
his sovereign, and who now craved Constantine’s protection.
He further desired them to begin at once to call him by his
assumed name, that they might make no mistakes on their
arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>The voyage was uneventful, and the adventurers soon reached
their destination.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/i_035.jpg' alt='KING ROTHER’S VOYAGE.' class='ig007' />
<p>KING ROTHER’S VOYAGE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first to land were “Dietrich” and old Berchther, and then
followed the flower of Rother’s army. Lastly the giants appeared,
inspiring awe and fear in every heart. All were clothed like
princes in splendid attire and with jewelled armour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The empress received the strangers with courtly grace, and
even the emperor looked pleased to see them. “Strangers,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
he said, “we should like to know from whence you come, who you
are, and what brings you to our good city. Before granting
you permission to remain here, we would fain know more about
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mighty sovereign of Greece, Hungary and Bulgaria,” answered
Dietrich, “we come from the realm of King Rother, where I bore
the title and power of duke. I helped my liege lord in all his
battles; but as I was always victorious, he grew jealous of my
good fortune, and I had to fly for my life. I have come here as
a fugitive with my faithful vassals, and all the wealth I could
carry, and now I entreat of you to grant me your protection,
for which I will repay you by faithful service in the field.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are an honest man,” replied the emperor, “and you
shall receive a fitting welcome. I was afraid at first that you
had come on the same errand as the ambassadors of King
Rother, who asked me to give my daughter in marriage to their
master. I have them safe under lock and key, where even the
light of the sun cannot reach them. Had your request been the
same as theirs, you and your men should have suffered the like
fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On hearing these words the giant Asprian started forward, the
whole room trembling beneath his mighty tread. “My lord,” he
cried, laying his hand upon his sword, “you might perhaps have
found that a more difficult task than you imagine. Before you
took us prisoners many of your guard would lie low, and who
can tell whether you yourself would have escaped scatheless?
<em>We</em> are not lambs to be slaughtered at the will of any man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Constantine did not much like this address, and tried to
smooth down the ruffled feelings of the giant. After some
further conversation he invited the strangers to dine at his table.
While they were eating, a tame lion, of which the emperor
was very fond, began to steal the food from under the hands of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
the guests. Asprian’s wrath was roused by the tempting morsel
being snatched away from him, and starting up he seized the
beast in his powerful hands, and flung him with such force against
the stone wall of the banqueting room, that he fell, never to
rise again. Constantine desired the guards to turn the giant out
of the hall, but the empress whispered, “Oh, take care what you
do. That man is not to be defied with impunity. King Rother
must be very powerful to have outlawed such men as these.
Take my advice, and set his messengers free. Let them take
our daughter home with them that she may be the wife of a
great king, and that she may induce her husband to be our
friend and ally.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Constantine listened in angry silence. At length he desired
his wife to be silent, reminding her that when once he had
made up his mind on any subject, he never changed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich and his friends took up their abode in the lodging
the emperor had assigned to them, and there they had their
treasures borne by the sailors: a labour that lasted many days.
Many were the gifts they showered on their new acquaintances,
amongst others, on Lord Helme and a brave and somewhat poor
warrior named Arnold. The latter was so touched by their
kindness that he swore to help his benefactor whenever he could.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Fair Oda.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The story of Dietrich’s wealth and generosity became known
in the palace, and Princess Oda was seized with an intense
curiosity to see the hero of so many tales. She took counsel
with Herlind, her chief lady-in-waiting, as to how she might
accomplish her purpose with most propriety. Then, acting on
her advice, she begged her father to get up some races, and allow
her and her ladies to watch the sport. The emperor consented,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
and on the appointed day a large assemblage of spectators
appeared on the course. The crush of people who collected
round Dietrich was so great that none of the ladies of the court
were able to get so much as a glimpse of him. The next day
Oda called Herlind into her room, and promised her five gold
bracelets if she would contrive a secret meeting between her
and the stranger. Herlind promised to do her best. She went
to Dietrich’s lodging, taking every precaution against being seen,
and gave him her mistress’s message. He refused to go and
see the princess, lest the news of his having done so should
leak out and come to the emperor’s ears. But before dismissing
Herlind, he gave her a golden and a silver shoe as a present.
She hastened back to her lady and told her all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a noble man,” said Oda, “and cares more for our
honour than for his own safety. I will keep the shoes in remembrance
of him, and will give you instead as many gold pieces
as they will hold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Herlind was satisfied with the proposal and now tried to put
the shoes on her lady’s feet, but could not, for they were both
made for the same foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go,” cried the princess, “he is not true. I will have none
of his gifts, and will think of him no more. Take back the
shoes and throw them at his feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wise Herlind understood how to interpret her mistress’s
command. She hastened to Dietrich, and told him that the
princess was angry with him, but that her curiosity to see him
was so great that she would no doubt pardon him if he took
a proper pair of shoes with his own hand. Dietrich seized the
first moment when he could reach the princess’s apartments
unobserved, and knocked at the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped on the threshold in amazement at the wondrous
beauty of the maiden who advanced to meet him. She was also
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
struck by his stately bearing and the resolute expression of his
handsome manly face. She had intended to show him her displeasure,
but she could not; she could only listen to the grave
and sensible explanation he gave of his conduct in not at once
obeying her commands. And when he asked permission to put
the shoes on her feet, she could not deny him. In course of conversation
he mentioned Rother’s offer for her hand, and then, little
by little, told her his secret, and the reason that had brought him
to Constantinople. He asked her for her love, and she promised
to be his wife. He now showed her that her father’s sentiments
being what they were, their only chance of happiness was to fly
together, and explained that before they could attempt to make
their escape his faithful servants, who were still confined in the
emperor’s dungeons, must be set at liberty. He begged Oda to
try to get them set free. She promised to do her best, and pointed
out the gloomy tower in which they were imprisoned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day the princess appeared before her father, dressed in
deep mourning, and told him that she had had a dreadful dream
that night. Her room had seemed full of flames from the nethermost
hell, and she had heard a voice call to her that if King
Rother’s twelve messengers were not brought out of their dungeons,
and furnished with clothes, food and wine, she would fall under
eternal condemnation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was the devil’s voice, not an angel’s,” answered Constantine,
“and I will not, on such a command, give up the rights
I possess by the grace of God. But if it will make you happier,
Oda, I will allow the prisoners to have their liberty for a short
time, on condition that some one will offer his life to me as bail
for them that they will not try to make their escape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Oda left her father’s presence much comforted, for she had
made up her mind what to do.</p>

<div class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
<span class='sc'>The Liberation of the Messengers.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>When the emperor, his guests and courtiers were seated at
dinner that day, Princess Oda entered the hall, followed by her
ladies. She went round the table, and told all and sundry of
her desire to liberate the twelve prisoners, and of the condition
her father had made. “Now who” she asked, “will let his head
be surety for the heads of these unhappy men?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A dead silence reigned in the hall. At last Dietrich rose in
his place, and in a loud clear voice offered himself as hostage
for the men. Upon which the emperor ordered the twelve counts
to be brought out of their prison, taken to the bath and provided
with clothes suitable to their rank and condition. This was
done, and while the poor fellows, scarcely able to believe their
senses, were seated at the meal provided for them, some one
outside began to play the harp. They listened intently, a deep
flush dyeing their sunken cheeks, and a flash of joyful surprise
brightening their sad eyes, for they recognised the air. “It is
he! Our king is near. He has come to save us!” they whispered
in awe-struck accents. Weeks passed, and light and food did
their work in restoring the strength of the prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day the door of their room opened, and Rother came in
dressed in his full armour. “You are free,” he said joyously,
but he had scarcely had time to greet them when Berchther
rushed forward to embrace his sons, followed by Wolfrat, the
hero of Tegeling, strong Asprian, and Widolt, his inseparable
companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rother told Leupold, and the rest, about their voyage, and
that he was only known to the Greeks by the name of Dietrich.
Then he told how he had won the love of fair Oda, and through
her help had gained their freedom at the risk of his own life.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
But the best was yet to come. Imelot, king of Desert-Babylon,
had invaded Constantine’s realm with a mighty army, and had
demanded half the empire, and the hand of Princess Oda for
his son Basilistum. “The emperor not knowing what to do,”
continued Rother, “I offered to help him if he would allow you
to join me and my friends. He consented, and so you are free
to become my comrades in battle. Your armour and weapons
lie without.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Widolt was so delighted at the thought of fighting that he
gave way to a stentorian burst of laughter, and nearly knocked
the emperor down by accident when he came in to tell the
prisoners that they were free.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>War and Victory.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Of all who followed Constantine into the field on that occasion,
Dietrich and his men were most worthy of notice; not only
because of the magnificence of their accoutrements, but from
their noble appearance. Chief amongst them were brave Wolfrat
of Tegeling in Bavaria, old Duke Berchther of Meran, his son
Leupold of Milan, and other counts of the West, and lastly
huge Asprian and his giants. These consulted together on the
eve of the day fixed on for the great battle, and determined that
when the Greek and Babylonian forces were asleep, they would
quietly slip out of their own camp, and, if possible, into that of
the enemy. At midnight they set out on their dangerous enterprise.
They passed the sentinels by means of the pass-word
they had taken care to find out, and softly made their way to
the king’s tent. It was a warm, but dark summer night; not
a star was visible; the king’s body-guard were asleep at their
post. They never awoke again on earth. Wolfrat stabbed them
as they slept, to guard against surprise. Widolt entered the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
royal tent, and picking Imelot up in his arms as though he had
been an infant, desired him to be silent as he valued his life.
The giant’s loud voice wakened some servants who slept near,
and they rushed into the tent to save their master, but were
speedily slain. The whole camp was now astir, but the efforts
of the soldiery were in vain. Confused by the darkness and their
sudden awakening, many were killed, while the greater number
fled, and sought refuge in their ships.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic008'>
<img src='images/i_043.jpg' alt='GIANT WIDOLT CARRIES OFF KING IMELOT.' class='ig008' />
<p>GIANT WIDOLT CARRIES OFF KING IMELOT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Rother and his handful of followers had thus won a complete
victory, and before daybreak had returned to their tents with
Imelot and some other princes of Desert-Babylon whom they
had taken prisoners. Thoroughly tired with their hard night’s
work, they threw themselves on their couches, and sought well-merited
repose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not so the Emperor Constantine. Contrary to his usual habit,
he was up and about at a very early hour, and ordered the horns
to blow to rouse the camp. This done, he desired that his troops
should pass before him in companies. All were present except
Lord Dietrich and his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! ha!” laughed the emperor scornfully, “so that fellow’s
high talk was all swagger. I will go and see what keeps him,”
and he trotted away to Dietrich’s tent.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he got there, he found that all was silent as the grave.
Motioning to his attendants to help him from his horse, he advanced
to wake the sleepers. In the first tent, he saw the grim
giant Widolt stretched upon a panther skin, while in the background
a man was tossing about on a bed of straw, bound hand
and foot. The emperor did not dare to wake the sleeper. He
stept over him carefully, and advanced close to the prisoner.
Imelot, in deadly fear lest he should be murdered on the spot,
shrieked out who he was, and offered the half of his kingdom in
exchange for his life. The noise wakened the giant. He sprang to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
his feet, and seizing his club, shouted to Dietrich to come, for some
treason was being hatched in their very tents. He would certainly
have killed both monarchs on the spot, had his companions not
hastened to his side and hindered him. When Constantine heard
the occurrences of the previous night, he was filled with surprise
and admiration. He gave a solemn feast in honour of the victory,
which in public he ascribed to himself, for were not Dietrich
and his companions in his pay at the time? In order that the
empress and her ladies might not be kept in ignorance of what
had happened, Constantine sent Dietrich and his men on in
advance to bear the news to the capital.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Bringing Home the Bride.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The Western heroes rode back to Constantinople light-hearted
and happy, for Dietrich had told them that the hour of their
return home was near. The first step, in his opinion, was to proclaim
that Imelot had conquered and dispersed the Greek army,
and was rapidly marching on the capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All is lost,” they cried, when the citizens came out to meet
them, “fly, save yourselves while you may. Imelot’s wild horde
of savages will soon be upon you.” Then galloping to the palace,
Dietrich entreated the empress to come on board his galley with
her daughter and her ladies, and to bring anything of value that
she particularly cared for.</p>

<p class='c007'>They soon reached the strand. Oda crossed the plank leading
to the vessel, her hand resting trustfully on Dietrich’s arm. Then
the plank was withdrawn and the ship pushed from land. The
empress wept and begged that she might be taken too, but
Dietrich explained to her the true state of the case, and telling
her who he was, assured her that Oda was going home with him
to rule over the West as his beloved queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
“Ah,” said the mother, much comforted, “be kind to her,
noble hero, and take my blessing on you both. Think of me
sometimes, as I shall think of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a pleasant voyage the travellers arrived at Bari, where
the marriage of King Rother to the princess was celebrated
with all pomp.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Constantine returned with his victorious army to Constantinople,
and learnt what had happened, he was very angry.
Had he not feared Rother and his gigantic allies, he would have
sent an army to Bari to fetch back the princess. The whole
city was in such confusion, that King Imelot had not much difficulty
in effecting his escape and returning to his own land. The
emperor did not fret much when he heard this news. He could
think of nothing but the loss of his daughter. He cared not for
the rich dishes in which he used to delight, nor for the delicate
wines his steward brought to tempt his appetite. He grew thin
and pale, and his clothes hung loose on his shrunken frame.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Mountebank.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>One day when he was alone in his room, a chamberlain came
to him and announced that a clever mountebank had come, who
would be sure to amuse his Majesty and turn his thoughts into
a pleasanter channel. The mountebank was admitted. The
emperor watched him perform all his curious tricks without a
smile. But when the man sang of a woman who had been stolen
from her home, and whose friends had freed her by means of
cunning, not strength, he listened with his whole soul in his eyes.
When the song was finished, he signed to the man to approach
him, and asked him if he could bring Oda home to Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me,” answered the mountebank, “a goodly ship, well
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
filled with merchandise, and I promise to bring the lady back to
you. You may send some of your soldiers with me if you like,
that they may cut off my head if I fail to keep my promise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before long the ship was laden and ready for sea. It was a
fast sailer, and there were many able seamen on board, to say
nothing of the soldiers the emperor had sent to see that the
player was true to his bargain.</p>

<p class='c007'>All went well during the voyage, and the ship at last reached
the port of Bari. The mountebank landed and set to work to
find out all that he could about the royal family. He found
that King Rother had gone to Riffland with his troops, leaving
Leupold of Milan regent in his place. He congratulated himself
on his good luck when he heard this, for he thought his plan
would be easier of accomplishment during the king’s absence.
On his return to his ship he made ready to show off his conjuring
tricks on board the vessel. Crowds came, tempted by the
unusual sight. He then brought out his silks and precious stones
and offered them for sale. Amongst his wares was a pebble.
The people asked what good a wretched common pebble could
do him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This stone,” he said, taking it gently in his hand, “is worth
a ton of gold, for if a queen should touch a lame or impotent
man with it, he would at once become strong and well again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah,” sighed one of the lords, “if that were only true! I
would give half my county were it really so, for I have three
children, all of whom have been lame from their birth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They would soon jump about and play like other children,”
replied the mountebank, “if your good queen would only come
on board my ship and try the virtue of the pebble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The count hastened to Queen Oda and told her his story,
and she, with her usual kindliness, said how willing she was to
cure the children if she could. She at once set out for the vessel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
but no sooner were she and her ladies on board than the landing
plank was slipped, the hawsers were unloosed, and a fresh wind
catching the sails, the ship was soon out of sight of land.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Rother to the Rescue.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The citizens of Bari clustered about the harbour not knowing
what to do, and Leupold vainly sought a ship that could be got
ready immediately to pursue and overtake the robber’s vessel.
At the same moment King Rother’s horns were heard proclaiming
his return. As soon as the king was told what had happened,
his decision was formed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must take an army to Constantinople,” he cried. “My
dear wife has been stolen from me by force and cunning, and by
force and cunning I will win her back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Duke Berchther shook his grey head, but said that he and
his men would follow the king. Leupold, Wolfrat and the other
princes of the realm promised to do the same. Messengers were
sent to bear the tidings to all parts of the kingdom, and soon
a great army was assembled. Rother picked out the bravest
warriors to accompany him, amongst whom were Asprian and
his giants; the rest he sent home. Meantime the ships that
were to bear the little army had been got ready, and after a
favourable voyage reached the neighbourhood of Constantinople.
Rother gave orders that the vessels should be run ashore in a
small bay, surrounded on all sides by a thick wood which
stretched in the direction of the city, and which would serve
to conceal both ships and men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are safe here,” said Rother to his nobles. “The populace
have an unspeakable terror of this wood, which they
believe to be peopled by monsters of all sorts. Let the men
encamp here, and I will go to the city in a pilgrim’s dress and
see what is going on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
There was a general outcry at the idea of the king adventuring
himself alone in the enemy’s stronghold, and many of the
princes offered to go with him. He, therefore, consented to
take the Duke of Meran and his son Leupold. Before starting
Wolfrat gave him a tiny horn, telling him the sound it made
was so shrill that it could be heard for miles around.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as we hear it,” said Asprian, “we shall come to
your help with clubs and swords.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” laughed Widolt, “and then there will be many a
broken head, I can promise you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The three pilgrims set out on their way. After going some
distance they saw a horseman coming towards them in shining
armour. They asked him if there were good news in Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all,” he answered. “Look, King Rother gave me this
coat of mail, and my good sword, and a thousand gold pieces
to boot, for I had lost both land and wealth at the hands of
miscreants; and now I find that the Greeks have stolen away
his fair wife, and are about to marry her to that cruel demon
Basilistum, son of Imelot, King of Desert-Babylon. For, when
Imelot escaped from here, he collected a great army, and marching
into the Emperor Constantine’s land, took him prisoner, and
now demands the half of his empire and the Lady Oda for that
unlicked cub, his son, who, according to the present arrangement,
is to remain here after his marriage, that Constantine may
not be deprived of his daughter’s society. All the Christians in
the place tremble to think of the persecutions that will follow.
Oh that King Rother would only come! I would join him with
all my men as sure as my name is Arnold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Truly,” said Rother as they parted, “a kind action often
brings unlooked-for reward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The city was full of life and feasting. Imelot, Constantine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
and their followers were hobnobbing together in the banqueting
room in the greatest peace and concord, for Constantine was
overjoyed at having settled the vexed question of his daughter’s
marriage without losing her altogether. The hunchbacked bridegroom
sat between his father and his would-be father-in-law and
close to sad Oda and her equally sorrowful mother. The doors
were wide open, that the populace might come in and watch the
proceedings. So the three pilgrims were able to enter unnoticed,
with their hats pulled down low over their brows. They heard
Constantine, Imelot, and Basilistum boast of how they would
scornfully entreat and hang King Rother and all his giants if
they ventured to come within their reach. During the laughter
and confusion caused by these speeches, Rother managed to slip
a ring bearing his name into his wife’s hand, and she, with a
look of intense relief, showed it to her mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rother is here,” cried the hunchbacked bridegroom suddenly.
“He has just given my wife a ring with his name engraved on
it. Seek him out and seize him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Swords were drawn, tables overturned, and noisy shouts heard
on every side. Rother and his companions came forward, and
the former said clearly and distinctly—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I am here. I have come to claim my wife, and if the
king of Desert-Babylon or his hunchbacked son deny my right,
I am ready to prove it on their bodies with my good sword.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Imelot laughed till the hall re-echoed. “Fight with <em>you</em>,”
he cried, “a poor little kinglet like <em>you</em>! No, no, you must be
hung.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He must be hung!” repeated the courtiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the gallows with him, and his comrades too,” continued
the Babylonish king, “seize them and bind them till the blood
starts from their fingers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes had only their pilgrim’s staves, and these were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
poor weapons wherewith to defend themselves against the swords
and lances that were pointed at them. They were taken and
bound. No hand was raised to help them, although many a
hardy fellow in the crowd had cause to remember Dietrich’s
kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A king,” said Rother proudly, “who has often looked death
in the face on the battle-field, knows how to die when his time
comes. Let the executioner do his work in the haunted wood,
where Constantine has already had so many innocent men put
to a shameful death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A good idea,” quoth the emperor grimly. “There are gallows
there that will just do to hang the stealer of women and
his comrades on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is right,” laughed Imelot, “and then the monsters
who inhabit the wood will come at night and play many a
merry prank with their bones. If their friends the giants should
come over the sea in search of Rother and his crew, we will
hang them too, that they may find themselves in good company.
The whole army shall see how great Imelot revenges himself
upon his foes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The preparations for the execution were finished in a few hours,
and the prisoners were borne to the haunted wood amidst an
immense crowd and the music of drums and trumpets. The
populace were curious to see a king hanged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so it is Dietrich, kind Dietrich,” sighed one; while
another laughed and answered, “What does that matter to us?
It is all the same whether a man is a king or a beggar when
he comes to be hung.” “Ah yes,” said a third, “the rope is an
uncomfortable necktie for any man, but that it should be tried
on a crowned head is a thing I never expected to see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The procession arrived at its destination. The prisoners were
led to the foot of the gallows.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
“Be of good cheer, Sir King,” said the executioner; “you
once gave me a handful of gold pieces, and to show you my
gratitude I have provided a silken rope for you, that will do
the business very quickly. The other two gentlemen must put
up with common hemp, I am sorry to say. By St. Michael, I
never did a day’s work before, that I liked so ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pray loose my hands for a moment, good fellow,” asked
Rother, “that I may say a prayer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A pious wish,” replied the man. “I will also pray to my
patron saint, and beg him to take you straight to heaven from
the gallows-tree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He loosed the king’s hands as he spoke, and then began to
pray. Meanwhile Rother drew out his horn from under the pilgrim’s
mantle, where it was concealed. Three times its wild call
sounded over mountain and valley, like a cry for help to the
faithful friends who were waiting fully armed in the depths of
the wood. But King Imelot, growing impatient, commanded
that the executioner should himself be hung if he delayed any
further to do his duty. The man was frightened and began to
bind Rother’s hands again; but at that moment a loud noise
was heard in the background.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Arnold, who, with his men, had joined Rother’s other
friends, and who now came with them to the rescue of his former
benefactor. There was a fearful battle. Imelot and many more
fell fighting desperately, while Basilistum was slain during the
flight. The whole army of Desert-Babylon was scattered or
destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the victory King Rother asked for the emperor, but
found that Constantine had thought “prudence the better part
of valour,” and had long before fled to the palace, where he
had taken refuge in the women’s apartments. His courage had
all ebbed away, and he begged his wife and daughter to entreat
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
Rother to save him out of the hand of the giants, those veritable
children of the evil one. The ladies were soon ready to
go out and meet the ruler of the West. They placed the timid
emperor in their midst, and accompanied by a numerous train,
set out for the wood. The first people they met were the giants.
Asprian’s falcon-eyes at once spied out the emperor, carefully as
he tried to hide himself. Stretching his long arm over the empress,
he seized him by the scruff of the neck and flung him on the
ground. Widolt raised his club to put an end to him as he
lay there senseless, but his master stopped him, saying—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not so, Widolt; away with the miserable wretch to the gallows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The giant caught the emperor up as easily as if he had been
a baby, and went dancing along the road to the gallows with
him in his arms. But they soon came up with Rother and his
heroes, and the king pardoned Constantine. He could not have
done otherwise: his wife was once more in his arms, and where
love rules, wrath and vengeance have no place. When they all
met in the banqueting room that evening, the emperor found
himself unusually hungry after the many and varied emotions
he had gone through, and it is said that he devoured a whole
leg of mutton, and drank an immense quantity of wine.</p>

<p class='c007'>King Rother left the whole of the Eastern empire, which he
had just conquered, in the hands of his father-in-law, and then
set sail for Bari accompanied by Queen Oda. Arrived there,
they went on to Rome, where a second marriage was solemnized
with great pomp. Rother and his wife lived long and
happily together, and had many children. We shall hear pleasant
things of their daughter Herka (or Herche, Helche), and
their grand-daughter Herat, as time goes on.</p>

    <h3 id='p1c1s3' class='mt'>III.<br />
    ORTNIT</h3>

<p class='dc3'>A great king once lived in
Lombardy; he was richer
and more powerful than any
other monarch far or near. His
name was Ortnit, and his dominions extended over the whole
of Italy from the Alps to the sea, and even included Sicily.
The neighbouring kings were all his vassals, for, possessing the
strength of twelve ordinary men, he was, of course, victorious
in every battle. And yet he was not contented. An inward
unrest prevented him from enjoying his wealth and greatness.
He often sat dreamily at table, tasting nothing, and deaf to all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
that was being said around him; deaf even to the minstrels,
when they sang songs in his praise. He frequently wandered
alone up in the mountains, seeking adventures, slaying robbers,
and destroying the wild beasts that preyed upon the farmers’
flocks and herds. But this did not satisfy him; he sighed for
something more.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day when he was standing, as he often did, on the sea-shore,
watching the waves that rose and fell, tinted by the light
of the setting sun, a mist came up out of the water. A few minutes
more, and it parted slowly like a veil, showing a wondrous
sight. It was that of a castle with towers and barbican, and
on the battlements stood a woman such as he had never seen
before in all his travels. He could not take his eyes off her.
The effect of her beauty on him was like enchantment. Then
the mist gradually closed again, and lady and castle vanished
as completely as if they had never been.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Ortnit was still staring at the place where he had seen
the lady, he heard a step behind him. “Ah, it is she!” he
thought, and turning quickly, clasped and kissed—bearded Ylyas
(Eligas, or Elias), prince of the wild Reussen, who was his uncle.
The new comer returned the embrace heartily, and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a good lad to receive your mother’s brother with
as much transport as a lover his sweetheart, but you have been
gazing at a bit of sorcery down there, and that accounts for
a great deal. Try to forget what you have seen, or your royal
head may soon be displayed from the towers of Muntabure,
where the lovely witch lives with that old heathen, her father.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is a real person then,” cried Ortnit quickly. “She must
be mine. I would stake my life to win her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that you say?” answered Ylyas. “A king’s head
for a woman’s curl! That would make a new song for the minstrels
to sing in Lombardy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
“How am I to find her?” asked the king. “Tell me the
story, which I suppose some wandering fiddler has sung.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, nephew,” replied the elder man, “I have seen with my
own eyes and have heard with my own ears what I am now
going to tell you. It is no minstrel’s tale I am going to amuse
you with. Machorell is the name of the maiden’s father, and
he is ruler of Syria, Jerusalem, and other eastern lands. When
I was returning from my pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre, I
arrived one evening at the gates of Castle Muntabure, weary
and footsore, and the Saracen porter had compassion on me, took
me in, and showed me no little kindness. Then it was that I
saw the wicked heathen king, whose skin is as black as that of
a Moor, and also the beautiful princess Sidrat. I heard it said
that he intended to marry his own daughter, when her sick
mother was dead, and that was why he cut off the heads of all
the wooers who came to ask for the princess’s hand in marriage.
Seventy-two skulls already grin from the towers of Castle Muntabure.
Say, bold youth, do you intend to offer your head to the
Moorish king as the seventy-third?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been through many a strange adventure before now,”
returned Ortnit, “and I shall try to get the better of the infidel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the following day the notables of the realm were summoned
to a council. The king told them that he intended to
make a campaign in Syria, and desired their help in calling
together his army. After many attempts to dissuade Ortnit
from such a fantastic enterprise, all was at last settled as he
wished, even to the appointment of the governors and deputy-governors
in whose hands the country was to be left during
his absence. The only person besides the king who carried his
point was Ylyas, who insisted on his right to go to Syria or
anywhere else he chose, and expressed his firm determination
not to lose sight of his nephew.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
As the council were separating, Zacharis appeared. He was
Lord of Apulia and Sicily, a heathen, but a faithful comrade of
the king. When he heard what they had settled, he at once
announced his readiness to provide a ship to take the armament
across the sea, for which offer the king thanked him warmly. On
the advice of Ylyas, it was agreed to put off the expedition until
spring, when the weather would be more favourable for a sea
voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the king had to smother his impatience as best he might.
He was very lonely, for he knew that no one quite sympathized
with him. His mother, indeed, did her best to persuade him to
give up the enterprise, by setting its dangers plainly before him,
and telling him how ridiculous it was to be so much in love with
a woman whom he had only seen in a vision, and about whose
character and disposition he knew nothing. He fretted against
the idleness and uniformity of the life he was leading, and determined
to ride up into the mountains for something to do. When
he went to take leave of his mother, she begged him not to go,
for fear of some accident happening to him; but, finding that
he was not to be dissuaded, she took a ring from her finger, saying,
“If you are determined to go, take this ring. The gold is thin,
and the stone of little apparent value, but it possesses a magic
power that could not be bought with a kingdom. Go where you
like in the wild mountains, but first of all ride down the road to
the left, that leads over the heights to the lake, then sideways
under a wall of rock to the valley. Look about till you find a
spring gushing out of a rock, and, close to it, a great lime-tree;
there you will have a more wonderful experience than any you
could imagine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her voice trembled with nervous excitement, and her tearful
eyes seemed to entreat him to ask her no questions.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
<span class='sc'>Dwarf Alberich</span> (<span class='sc'>Ælf-ric</span>).</div>

<p class='c007'>Ortnit rode away. He forbade any of his serving-men to
accompany him, saying that he wished to be alone. The cool
fresh air blowing about his temples cheered him, and chased away
the fumes that troubled him. The sun began to sink as he
entered the wood, where he had to dismount and lead his horse,
because of the low-growing branches of the trees. The night
was so dark that he lost his way, and did not succeed in getting
out of the wood again till daybreak. When he gained the open,
he rested a short time to let his horse graze in the meadow, and
to eat his own breakfast. After that he set out again for the
mountains, and at length reached the wall of rock his mother
had mentioned. He rode along the foot of it, as she had told
him, till he heard the gurgling of the spring, and, on turning a
corner, saw the lime before him. It was an immense tree, and
early as it was in the year, it was already covered with leaves and
blossom. Ortnit found on looking around, that it was in a wide
meadow, on which grass, clover, and many-coloured flowers grew
in rich abundance, while the number of birds that nested in the
lime-tree was quite unheard of. A curious feeling came over the
king, it seemed as if he must have heard those birds’ song of
welcome in his childhood, and all at once he remembered a ditty
his mother used to sing. He began to hum it softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a song about all the little birds, and the music each
made after its kind, sweet as a summer day, and all in honour
of Alberich, king of the wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alberich—king of the wood,” Ortnit was sure that he had
once heard more about him than that, but what it was he could
not tell. Had he not played with a child of that name once?
As he was puzzling over these confused memories of the past,
he happened to glance at his mother’s ring; the stone in it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
shining like a fire, and lighting up the face of a lovely child, who
lay asleep in the grass close by.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor boy,” said the royal hero, compassionately, “I wonder
who brought you to this lonely place! How anxious your mother
must be about you! I cannot leave you here to die of hunger
or fall a defenceless prey to the wild beasts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had already fastened his horse to a branch, and stooping
down, he lifted the boy in his arms to carry him away; but to his
intense surprise he received such a blow on the chest that he not
only let the child fall, but himself tumbled on his back. He had
scarcely recovered his footing, when he found the child holding him
so tight that he had to exert all his strength not to be overthrown.
It was a strange sight to see the tall king and the wonderful child,
wrestling furiously together. Flowers and grass were trodden
under foot, shrubs and low bushes broken and torn, when Ortnit
at last flung his opponent on the ground, and drew his sword to
slay him. But, angry as he was, he could not do it when the little
thing gazed at him so entreatingly, and begged in such a sweet
soft voice that he would not murder him when he was defenceless,
but would accept, in exchange for the life he granted him, a
valuable suit of armour, consisting of helmet, shield, and coat of
mail of wrought gold and silver, and last not least, the sword
called Rosen, whose blade had been rendered strong and durable
in dragon’s blood. When Ortnit demanded a hostage for his
opponent’s good faith, the little creature told him that hostages
were impossible to find in that wild mountain country, but Ortnit
might trust to his word, for he also was a king, and ruled over a far
wider domain than Lombardy, though truly his realm lay beneath
the earth instead of upon it, and his subjects were employed day
and night in working in metals. Finding that no hostage was
necessary, or indeed procurable, the hero allowed his prisoner to
get up. But before the latter went to get the armour he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
promised, he said that he would like to have the ring Ortnit was
wearing, and that he scrupled the less to ask for it, as it did
not appear to be of great value.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot give it to you,” replied Ortnit, “for it was a present
from my dear mother, who would never forgive me if I parted
with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you call yourself a hero,” sneered the little creature,
“<em>you</em> who fear your mother’s blows! Tell me, what do you do
when you are wounded in battle? Do you cry like a baby when
you see the blood flow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you were to hew me in pieces,” replied the Lombard,
“painful as that would be, it would hurt me less than a tear or
a sigh from my mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, good squire of dames,” continued the other, “it can at
any rate do the ring no harm for me to look at it and touch
it. I am in your power, am I not? Your sword is in your hand,
and I am without a weapon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a little hesitation the king consented to let the boy draw
the ring from his finger; but scarcely was this done, when he
vanished from before his eyes, suddenly and without warning.
Ortnit felt bewildered. He heard the boy’s voice, now at a
distance and now near, making sarcastic remarks on the beating
his mother would give him when he went home, and finally
announcing that he would pelt him with a few pebbles to show
him how well he could do it. Ortnit defended himself for some
time against the terrible storm of sharp stones that rained upon
him, but at last, seeing that neither his great strength nor his
sword were of any avail, he turned to his horse and prepared
to ride away.</p>

<p class='c007'>On perceiving this the hobgoblin exclaimed: “Wait a bit,
friend Goodman. I am sorry to think of the stripes your mother
will give you. Listen to me. I have many important things
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
to talk to you about. If you will give me your royal word
of honour that you will not revenge yourself for the trick I played
you, I will give you back your ring.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” answered Ortnit, “I promise on my honour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if I go on to talk ill of your mother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” cried the king, “I will never forgive that. You may
say what you like about me, but my mother is the purest and
most perfect of women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I quite agree with you,” said the little creature; “you may
listen to me without fearing that I shall slander her, for I am
Alberich (Ælf-ric) king of the Dwarfs, and you and I are more
nearly related than you think. I will tell you the truth; but first
take back your ring. I trust to your word of honour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The moment Ortnit felt the ring in his hand, he slipped it
back on his finger, and immediately saw the boy standing before
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must know, great king,” pursued Alberich, “that you
have to thank me for your land and people, castles, towns and
victories, and also for your marvellous strength. Your predecessor,
whom you call father, married, when he was an elderly
man, the youthful sister of the prince of the wild Reussen. The
marriage was childless. Husband and wife in vain prayed heaven
for an heir. Your mother was the best and most virtuous woman
in Lombardy, but she wore herself away with fretting about what
would become of the country and herself when her husband died
without an heir. She foresaw that the nation would be split into
factions, that civil war would desolate the land, and that she
herself might be chased from Lombardy, a homeless exile. I often
heard her plaints when I entered her room unseen. The older the
king grew, the more her anxiety increased; then—well, you must
know it sooner or later—I became her second husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Monster, you lie!” shouted Ortnit, drawing a dagger from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
his side, but he could not use it, for the smiling boy looked up at
him so fearlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your anger is bootless,” he said. “You had better let me
finish my story. Young as I look, I am five hundred years old;
small as I am, and big and strong as you are, I am yet your father.
I proposed to the king that he should secretly get a divorce from
his wife and let her marry me. He consented, but she would not.
She refused. She spent days and months in weeping, and only
gave way at last when her husband insisted! She and I were
married secretly by a priest. No one guessed what had happened,
and when you were born you were supposed to be the old
king’s son. I did not win my wife’s heart, however, until her
first husband was dead. After that I used sometimes to bring
her here; you and I played together among the flowers like two
children, and I sang with the birds that wild song of theirs about
the king of the wood, which your mother often sung to you again
at Castle Garden. When you grew to be a man and a hero, I was
often at your side unseen, while the battle raged all round you, and
on those occasions I have often turned aside the point of some
murderous weapon that threatened your life. When you cross the
wild ocean, and strive to win the Moorish maiden for your wife, I
will be there to help you. So long as you wear that ring on your
finger, you have only to wish for me and you will see me. Now
wait a few minutes; I am going to fetch the armour that no
weapon can pierce, and the sword Rosen, which can cut through
steel and iron, and even dragon’s scales.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ortnit felt as though in a dream. While he was still thinking
over all that he had just heard, the sound of heavy steps, and the
clanking of armour startled him out of his reverie. Turning
round he saw Alberich, who with the help of a sturdy dwarf was
bringing his promised gift. On the top of the silver helmet with
gold enwrought, was a priceless diamond. The whole suit of mail
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
was of marvellously beautiful workmanship, and sparkled with
gems wherever gems should be. The sword was in a golden
sheath, its handle was a shining carbuncle, and on the sharp steel
blade were golden figures and the letters forming the king’s name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ortnit was amazed at the beauty of all he saw. He put on the
armour, and it fitted him exactly. Then he picked his tiny father
up in his strong arms and kissed him on his rosy mouth, and
Alberich returned his embrace with much affection. As the king
rode away, the last words he heard were, “Do not forget the
importance of that ring. Never give it away. If you turn it on
your finger, I will at once be with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Ortnit got home, he was received with joy by all his
retainers; and his mother, who was watching for his arrival, signed
to him to come to her. He instantly ran up the steps, and
whispered as he kissed her, “I have come from father Alberich.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know?” she asked, hiding her face on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” he answered, “that I love and honour my dear
mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>May came at last. The army assembled and marched south
through Tuscany, Rome and Naples, whence they embarked for
Sicily, Messina being the place fixed on for the general meeting of
all the forces. Arrived there, they found faithful Zacharis ready
with his ship, in which he had stowed away, not only enough
provisions for the voyage, but also merchandise, in case it should
be wanted. Soon every man was on board, a favourable wind
swelled the sails, and experienced seamen steered the ship through
the wild sea.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>City of Suders</span> (<span class='sc'>Tyre</span>).</div>

<p class='c007'>After they had journeyed a long time, the welcome cry of
“land” was heard from the mast-head, and soon afterwards those
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
on deck had a distinct view of the shore and the wharfs of Tyre.
But at this moment the skipper came up to the king and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire, we are all lost. There is no wind to carry us past this
place. They have sighted us already in the town, and will soon
send out their pirate ships to chase us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, nephew,” said Ylyas, “throw the cowardly dog overboard
to drink brotherhood with the fishes. Have we not swords enough
to defend ourselves from the Moors?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir,” replied the skipper, “the heathen will throw Greek fire
on board. Neither sword nor shield can do aught against that.
The ship will be burnt, and all the men either burnt therewith
or drowned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No one knew what to advise, so all stood silent about the king.
Suddenly a voice was heard from the mast-head:</p>

<p class='c007'>“All arms below! Bring up the merchandise, and let the sails
be reefed, lest the enemy guess that we thought of flight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey-day! It is Alberich,” said Ortnit; “how could I have
forgotten him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked up and saw the king of the dwarfs slipping rapidly
down the mast to the deck. In another moment he was at his
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You forgot both the ring and me,” said Alberich, “but a father
does not so soon forget his son. Now hasten and see that my
commands are carried out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Much ashamed of himself, Ortnit gave the necessary orders.
All weapons of offence were stowed away below, and the costly
wares Zacharis had provided were spread temptingly on deck.
Meanwhile the dwarf climbed the mast again, and, as soon as he
was aloft, shouted to the Moors:</p>

<p class='c007'>“See here—we are peaceful merchants bringing wares from
Italy. Give us free convoy into the harbour of Tyre.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ylyas stared up open-mouthed at the top of the mast. The flag
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
was flying there as usual, and no one was to be seen. What voice
was that he had heard?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the devil on board?” he asked, crossing himself, “or is it a
good spirit? Whom did you speak to, nephew? Who called from
the top-mast even now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A good spirit,” replied Ortnit, “a little dwarf who will, help
us out of our difficulty. You shall see him with your own eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words he slipped his magic ring on his uncle’s finger,
and the latter was much astonished to see the small childish figure
descending the mast, still more when Ortnit gave him a hasty
sketch of all that had taken place.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Tyrian galleys had by this time come up with the ship.
Their commander, who introduced himself as constable of the city,
inquired whether the object of the strangers in coming to those
seas was really to trade with them. Satisfied that they were what
they appeared to be, because of the number and splendour of their
wares, he at last gave them leave to enter the harbour, and even to
land if they desired to do so. In the course of that afternoon
the townsfolk bought many rich Italian stuffs at a very low price.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the evening the two princes held counsel together as to what
was now to be done. Ylyas advised that a sudden onslaught
should be made on the castle, and that everybody there, young
or old, should be put to the sword. Before Ortnit could answer,
Alberich broke into the conversation by saying that such conduct
would not be fair, that no one who desired fame and glory would
take his enemy unawares; but for fear any herald sent to the
infidels should be murdered by them, he undertook to bear the
message of defiance himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alberich hastened to Muntabure by unfrequented roads. Arrived
there, he saw King Machorell standing on the ramparts enjoying
the cool evening air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen to me, Moorish king,” cried the dwarf from the castle
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
moat, “and mark what I tell you. My master, King Ortnit, desires
that you will give him your daughter to be his wife, and queen of
Lombardy. If you refuse your consent, he bids me declare war
on you at once, and warn you that he will attack Tyre before
daybreak to-morrow. After conquering it he will come on to
Muntabure, punish you for your evil deeds, and marry your
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, Goblin,” cried Machorell angrily, “you want to arrange a
marriage, do you? You will find both your own head and your
master’s adorning the battlements of my castle before long, if
you persist in your foolish scheme. But where are you? I cannot
see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Down below you in the moat,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king flung a heavy stone down upon the place where he
supposed Alberich to be, but missed his mark. He called out his
guards and made them search the whole neighbourhood, but they
returned at nightfall baffled and disappointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>That evening Ortnit made an onslaught on the city, and found
it totally unprepared for any attack. However, the Tyrians soon
got under arms and made a gallant defence; all in vain. Ortnit
was victorious after a hard struggle in which many of his faithful
followers were slain.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he returned from pursuing the Tyrians, Ortnit went
to the place where his uncle had fought, and found him lying
on the ground surrounded by his people. Was he dead or
only wounded? The king bent over him anxiously, and loosed
his helmet to see if he were yet alive. His heart had not
quite ceased to beat. As Ortnit was raising him in his arms,
he happened to touch him with Alberich’s ring, and in a
moment Ylyas was on his feet, whole and sound, as though he
had never been wounded. It was well for Ortnit that it was
so, for in another instant he and his men were attacked by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
the train-bands of the city, who had rallied once more. At
length they also were beaten back with immense loss, and
Tyre was really in his hands. Those of the citizens that were
left swore fealty to the king of Lombardy, who then gave
orders to attend to the wants of the wounded, both friends
and foes. He allowed his followers a few days’ rest before
leading them against Muntabure.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Castle Muntabure.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>After much consideration it was agreed between Ylyas and
the king that Alberich was the best person to be standard-bearer
during the assault, and the dwarf at once consented.
The warriors were filled with amazement when they saw a
war-horse preceding them with the royal banner apparently
floating by its side. “The invisible standard-bearer must be an
angel,” they said in awe-struck tones. Nothing of importance
happened during the march. All went well, for Alberich led
the van.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last Castle Muntabure loomed in sight: a grim fortress
perched on the top of a beetling crag.</p>

<p class='c007'>Machorell had heard of their approach, and was in readiness
to receive them. He had strengthened the garrison very considerably,
and was confident of victory. At first it seemed as
if his confidence were well-founded; but at the very moment
when the Saracens appeared to have success within their grasp,
the tide of fortune turned. Alberich climbed the walls unseen,
and by a great exertion of his marvellous strength, hurled
one heavy catapult after another down from the walls into
the moat below; while the men who had been working these
engines of destruction were struck motionless with terror, when
they saw the unwieldy machines disappear as though shoved
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
from their places by invisible hands. Ortnit seized the right
moment to push the advantage the dwarf had gained for him,
and renewed the assault more vigorously than before.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Sidrat the Beautiful.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Alberich now left the walls, and opening a side-door made
his way to a tower-like building that rose above the battlements.
This was the temple where the Moors kept their idols, Mahomet
and Apollo; two enormous figures carved in stone. The queen
and her daughter, beautiful Sidrat, knelt before the idols praying
for protection from the invaders. Suddenly Sidrat felt her
hand grasped gently by an invisible hand. At first she was
frightened, and then comforted, for she took it as a sign that
her prayers were heard. But the unseen friend was Alberich,
and not a heathen god. He whispered, “Your gods are dust;
I am a messenger from another world, and have come to save
you and to teach you to worship the true God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl started to her feet in terror, and hastened to her
mother, who was kneeling at a little distance. Meanwhile the
dwarf flung the idols down and broke them in pieces, and the
women were more alarmed than ever, for they felt convinced
that an evil spirit was at work within the temple.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alberich went back to the princess, and drew her to the
barbican, whispering, “See, there is the hero who desires to
make you his wife, and queen of his realm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Involuntarily she looked down, and saw Ortnit fighting
valorously, driving all before him, and looking god-like in his
grace and noble bearing. She could not turn away her eyes.
He was even now advancing to attack her father. They exchanged
one or two blows, the last of which split Machorell’s
shield. Ortnit raised his sword to strike again, but Sidrat
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
uttered a loud cry of agony, and he refrained, for at the same
moment he saw her standing on the barbican, and knew that
she was the maiden he had loved ever since he had seen her
image in the magic castle on the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see the royal hero?” asked the dwarf; but receiving
no answer, he went on: “Go down to the moat to-morrow
morning at day-break. Your father will allow you to do so, if
you tell him you are going to call upon your gods to return
to the castle. But when you reach the moat, you will find the
king waiting to speak with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowing that his advice would be followed, he left the
princess.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle had ceased to rage as furiously as before, and all
were weary after their exertions. Ortnit’s men retired to the
river-side, where they were to encamp for the night, and the
Moors shut themselves within the fortress.</p>

<p class='c007'>All night long Ortnit dreamt of Sidrat, and then awoke and
wondered whether she would come to the trysting-place. In
the early morning, before the sun was up, the king mounted
his horse and rode away alone to Muntabure. He concealed
himself beneath the spreading boughs of a tamarind-tree, and
waited and waited, doubting, fearing, would she come or would
she not? At length a postern door opened, and a white figure
came out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sidrat,” he cried, and clasped her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To horse, delay not a moment,” whispered the dwarf; “go
down that way, past the waterfall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ortnit at once obeyed, placed the maiden upon his horse,
and mounted himself. It was high time. He had scarcely got
beyond arrow-shot, when a watchman on the tower recognised
him by his helmet, and sounded the alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Machorell and his men-at-arms hurried down to the fight.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
Several times the fortune of the day changed sides; and when
at length the battle was over, the besiegers were too much
weakened in number to attempt to carry the castle by storm;
while the besieged were also in woeful plight, and their sorrow
was increased by the loss of the princess.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ortnit began his retreat next morning. He found on his
arrival at Tyre that his ship was in good order and ready
for sea. So he gave orders for a speedy departure, and soon
the gallant little army was speeding homewards with Princess
Sidrat and much spoil. The Moorish girl proved a willing pupil
when the Christian priests of Lombardy taught her their religion,
so she was baptized, and received the name of Liebgart. Soon
after that, she and Ortnit were married at Castle Garden, and
the whole country rejoiced in the king’s good fortune.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Toad’s Eggs.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Ortnit and his wife were very happy together, and smiling
peace rested on the land. Honours were showered upon the
hero of so glorious a campaign, and even the imperial crown of
Rome was placed upon his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day when Ortnit and his queen were seated in the
banqueting hall, their warriors feasting around them, a stranger
was announced, who said that he had come from the East, and
was the bearer of rich presents to the royal pair. After a few
minutes’ delay, the ambassador was admitted. He was of gigantic
height, wild of aspect, and said that his name was Welle. He
announced that King Machorell had sent him to make friends
with Ortnit in his name and for his fair daughter’s sake; that
the king, in token of his reconciliation with his son-in-law, had
sent him the finest jewels to be found in all Syria. Having
thus spoken, Welle called his wife, Ruotze. She at once appeared,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
and was even taller and more hideous than himself. She
dragged four great coffers into the hall, the contents of which
she unpacked and displayed before the king and queen and all
the court. The first contained dresses and steel wares of every
sort and kind; the second was full of silver bracelets and
ornaments of wonderful workmanship; the third was the same,
except that the ornaments were of gold instead of silver. The
fourth case was opened by the man himself, who lifted out of it,
very carefully, two enormous eggs of strange form and colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These are the eggs of the Abrahamic magic toad,” said the
man. “When they are hatched, which my wife will see to, you
will find in each the wondrous toad-stone, that shines like
the sun in a dark place, or else a marvellous creature that will
defend your coasts against every invader if you only feed it
well. I am King Machorell’s chief huntsman, and understand
how to bring up the beast, and feed, and teach it its duties.
So, I pray you, appoint me and my wife a damp and quiet
place amongst the mountains where we can watch over the eggs.
Next year my royal master himself will cross the seas, make
friends with you in person, and see the miraculous result of
our care with his own eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The queen’s heart was filled with joy at these signs of her
father’s forgiveness, and throwing her arms round her husband’s
neck, she entreated that the proffered friendship should be
accepted. The courtiers were quite of her opinion; but Zacharis,
the faithful heathen, shook his head, and spoke his distrust both
loudly and clearly. No one listened to him. The king gave
orders that the giants should be well treated, and provided
with food, and all they needed in the mountains, by the governor
of the province in which the place most suitable for
hatching the eggs was situated.</p>

<p class='c007'>High up in the mountains near Trient was a marshy bit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
ground, extending far within a cavern at the foot of a precipitous
rock. Welle and his wife took up their abode there, and
every day the governor sent them a supply of food. Ruotze
brooded over the eggs untiringly. Before very long the shells
cracked, and two little lind-worms (dragons) crept out. They
were pretty creatures, dainty in all their movements and obedient
to every command of the giant and his wife. The governor used
sometimes to go and see them, and delighted in their agility and
funny ways. The worst of it was that they had enormous appetites,
and the more they ate the faster they grew, and the more
they wanted to eat. They were soon taller than their guardians
when they raised themselves in the air, and began to show themselves
malicious and bad-tempered. The governor hesitated to
supply their wants when he found that they needed more than
two oxen a day; the wrath of the creatures at what they considered
semi-starvation was so great that Welle and Ruotze grew
frightened, and took refuge in another cave. As soon as their
guardians deserted them, the monsters crept out of their hole,
and began to wander over the whole district, devouring men and
cattle, and whatever came in their way. The people deserted
their old homes and fled to the mountain fastnesses. All in vain:
the lind-worms pursued them, and continued to devour all who
fell into their clutches. The governor sent out large detachments
of horse and foot against them, but hardly a man returned to
tell the tale of defeat and misery. And with every hearty meal
the monsters grew larger and stronger. Every one was in despair,
for it seemed as if the whole kingdom would be devastated.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Ortnit’s Fight with the Lind-worm.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>One day the Emperor Ortnit went to his wife and asked her
to help him to put on his armour, for he had to go out and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
fight a hard battle. She could hardly pronounce the words
“with whom?” she trembled so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Liebgart,” he said, “you must know that the dragons
which are doing so much harm to the country are the toad-stones
your father sent me. I am the guardian of my people;
and as they helped me when I went to Syria to win you, I
must now help them in my turn by going out against these
monsters to slay them,—or myself be slain, I know not
which.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The empress wept and told her fears, but her husband comforted
her by reminding her that he still had the good sword
Rosen, that could cut through steel and iron, and even dragon’s
scales. “Should I not return,” he continued, “an avenger will
come. If any one brings you back this ring that you once gave
me, you may know that he is my avenger, and give him your
hand in marriage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then kissed her and tore himself away. She gazed after
him with tearful eyes as long as he was in sight, thinking sadly
how many noble warriors had preceded him in his quest, and
how none of them had ever returned to home or friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ortnit at length reached the rock where he expected to find
the lind-worms. Seeing them nowhere, he dismounted, blew his
horn, and loosed the faithful dog that he had taken with him
to help him to hunt the monsters down. Suddenly a door in
the rock opened, and the giant Welle came out, shouting to
him to come on, and calling him opprobrious names; but the
king cut his great club in two with one stroke of his sword.
The giant sprang back, and in a moment had unsheathed a sword
six yards long, whirled it round his head, and struck Ortnit so
hard a blow upon the helmet that he fell senseless to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well hit, old moon-calf,” cried Ruotze, putting her head out
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
at the door; “let me go to him now and wring his neck, and
throw his body into the dragons’ den.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment the setter, which had disappeared in the
wood, began to bark furiously, and Ruotze rushed away to see
what was the matter. Upon this, Ortnit started to his feet, and
with a swing of his sword cut off one of the giant’s legs. The
monster howled with pain, and defended himself resting against
the rock, but his opponent immediately cut off his other leg.
Hearing the noise, the giantess returned. Arming herself with
an uprooted tree, she hit out at the hero with all her strength;
but, blinded by passion, she miscalculated the distance, and
brought the tree down so hard on her husband’s head that she
split it open. Ortnit then slew the giantess, after which he rested
awhile from his labours; ate and drank some of the provisions
he had brought with him, and let his steed graze at will on the
short sweet grass of the upland meadow. Rested and refreshed,
he once more set out on his quest. Riding through a wood, he
came up with some charcoal-burners, and asked them where he
should find the lind-worms. They tried to persuade him to turn
back, but in vain. Then they told him that the monsters had
set out to travel west; that one of them, having a nest of
young ones, had stayed somewhere on the road hidden in a cave,
while the other had gone deeper into the mountains, perhaps
even into another land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unheeding the warning he had just received, Ortnit rode away
towards the west. When evening came, he rested for a short
time; but as his food was nearly finished, and he wanted to
reach an inhabited spot as soon as possible, he set out again, and
rode all night long. Next day he reached a meadow, and there
he saw little Alberich seated under a tree. The dwarf looked
very sad, and when Ortnit drew rein beside him, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear son, you are going to your death. Return to Garden,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
for I have no power over the diabolical monsters you are seeking.
I cannot help you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I need no help,” replied the hero. “Have I not the sword
Rosen? It will help me to conquer the powers of hell that are
arrayed against my poor people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“May you be successful!” said the little creature, and springing
into the saddle he kissed his son. “May you be successful! and
to that end, watch and slumber not. Remember that it is the
last advice I can give you. Now give me back the ring you
got from your mother. You shall have it again if you return to
Garden safe and sound.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Scarcely had Ortnit returned the ring when he felt a kiss upon
his lips, and the dwarf had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero rode on unfalteringly over hill and dale, and through
many a wild glen. At last he unexpectedly reached the very
lime-tree under which he had had his first interview with Alberich.
The birds were singing as before. All looked peaceful and still.
Both Ortnit and his horse were worn out, so he dismounted, and
letting his steed graze, laid himself at full length on the soft grass,
his faithful dog at his side. He thought over his project, and was
strongly tempted to return home to Garden and sweet Liebgart;
but he put the desire from him, “for,” he reasoned within himself,
“the prince and people are as one person, of which the
people form the body and the prince the head; so the prince, to
be worthy of his high calling, must as far as in him lies protect
his people from all injury. And I have every right to trust to
my strength, my sword and my good cause for victory.” It
seemed as though the birds in the linden-tree had read his
thoughts, and were singing a pæan of joy and encouragement
over him and them. He watched them quietly, but soon fatigue
gained the upper hand—his eyelids closed, and he fell asleep.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic009'>
<img src='images/i_077.jpg' alt='THE DRAGON FINDS ORTNIT ASLEEP.' class='ig009' />
<p>THE DRAGON FINDS ORTNIT ASLEEP.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>All at once the birds ceased their song, the branches stopped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
their soft waving to and fro, and the flowers bent their heads as
though a breath of poisoned air were passing over them. Crawling
through the thicket, trees and bushes breaking with its
weight, came the terrible lind-worm, its jaws wide open, showing
its long pointed teeth. The faithful dog, with a howl of mingled
fear and anger, pulled at his master, hoping to wake him; but
in vain, for Ortnit was as though in a charmed sleep. The dog
then sprang upon the dragon, but could not touch it because
of the way it slashed about with its tail. At this moment the
horrible creature caught sight of Ortnit, flung itself upon him,
carried him into the thicket, and then broke all his bones by
dashing him again and again upon the ground. But though his
bones were broken, his armour remained whole as at the first.
Then taking the dead body up in its powerful jaws, the lind-worm
bore it home to its nest in the noisome cave, where its young
ones fell ravenously upon their favourite food, and devoured as
much as they could get at through the steel rings of the coat of
mail. The dog, which had followed the dragon home in hopes
of saving his master, watched all night by the cave, but finding
himself powerless to help, set out early next morning on his
way back to Garden.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Sidrat the Sorrowful (Liebgart).</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Liebgart and the old queen were very anxious.
They hoped and feared alternately. On the fourth day, as they
were sitting together, they heard something scratching at the
door. Liebgart opened it, and saw the faithful dog, her husband’s
companion on his last journey. Instead of showing his usual joy
at seeing her, the dog crept slowly in, and lay down at the old
queen’s feet with a low, moaning whine.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
“He is dead—murdered by the monsters,” cried the unhappy
mother. These were the last words she ever spoke, for next
moment she sank back dead in her chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shrieks of the young queen brought her women into the
room, and soon the sad news was known to all. There was now
no king in Lombardy, no one to keep order in the land. The
great nobles fought and quarrelled incessantly, and the country
was split into factions. At last, tired of this state of anarchy, it
was agreed by the notables in council that the only thing that
could save the kingdom was for Liebgart to choose a husband
who had sufficient wisdom and power to make a good ruler.
They went to the queen, each hoping in his secret heart that he
would be chosen by her. But on hearing what was required of
her, she answered with solemn earnestness that she would preserve
her faith to Ortnit unbroken, and that none was worthy to
succeed him unless he could slay the lind-worms and avenge his
death. The nobles looked at each other in a shamefaced manner,
and hastened to leave the royal presence; but avarice and
ambition soon regained the upper hand, and civil war seemed
imminent. Liebgart, deprived of all means of support,—for even
the treasury had been despoiled by the nobles,—was forced, in
company with a few women who were faithful to her, to make
her own livelihood by spinning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Margrave of Tuscany was much distressed when he
heard of the straits to which the queen was reduced. He offered
her an asylum in his country; but she said that at Garden she
had been happy with Ortnit, and there she also wished to
sorrow for him. Touched by her faithfulness, the prince sent
her food and wine, that she might no longer have to work for
the necessaries of life. So she lived on, the Lombards trying
to force her to seek refuge from the ills of life by a second
marriage; but in vain; she bore all the miseries of her lot with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
quiet patience, for she strengthened herself with thoughts of her
husband and of the avenger for whom she hoped.</p>

<p class='c007'>This hope, which sometimes rose like a star on the cloudy
night of sorrow in which she lived, was one day to be fulfilled,
but not for a long time.</p>

    HUGDIETERICH AND WOLFDIETERICH.</h3>

    <p class='center'><span class='sc'>Hugdieterich and Fair Hildburg.</span></p>

<p class='dc4'>While Ortnit’s ancestors
ruled over Lombardy, the
great Emperor Anzius lived at Constantinople, and governed
Greece, Bulgaria, and many other lands. When he died, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
confided his son, Hugdieterich, to the care of his faithful friend,
Berchtung, duke of Meran, whom he had himself brought up,
and afterwards covered with honours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Berchtung felt that his first duty was to choose a wife for
his ward, and that only a princess of equal rank and great
beauty and wisdom would be a suitable helpmeet for so
mighty a prince. He had travelled far and wide, and amongst
all the princesses he knew there was one and only one that
he could propose as a wife for his liege lord. But there were
many difficulties in the way. Berchtung confided his troubles
to the prince, and told him how much he wished to bring
about a marriage between him and Hildburg, daughter of King
Walgund of Thessalonica; but he feared it would be impossible,
for Walgund loved the maiden so dearly that he had shut her
up in a high tower, and permitted no one to speak to her
except the old watchman, himself, her mother, and her maid.
This he did, fearing lest she should marry and leave him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hugdieterich listened to the strange story with great interest,
and determined to get a sight of the maiden if he could. So
he set to work to learn all that he might of women’s works
and women’s ways, even going so far as to dress himself in
women’s garments. After which he announced his intention
of going to Thessalonica to make fair Hildburg’s acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c007'>He arrived in due course at Thessalonica, disguised as a great
lady, with a numerous train of female servants. Hearing of the
new arrival, the king and queen invited the stranger to visit
them. She did so, and gave their majesties to understand that
she was Hildgunde, sister of the emperor Hugdieterich, and
that she had been outlawed by her brother. She begged the
king to protect her, and to provide her with a lodging in his
palace, and at the same time presented the queen with a costly
piece of embroidery, as a sign of her good will. Her request
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
was granted. The queen then begged her to teach her ladies
to embroider as she did herself. After this all went so well
that Berchtung and his men-at-arms were sent back to Constantinople,
their protection being no longer needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fair Hildburg heard what was going on, and begged her
father to allow her to see the embroideries, and the artist who
worked them. No sooner had she done so than she wished to
learn the art. Walgund gave his consent, thinking the stranger
a very suitable companion for his daughter, and Hildburg
found great pleasure in her company. It was not until weeks
afterwards that she discovered who her teacher was, and when
she did their friendship became stronger than before, until it
grew into acknowledged love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fear lest their secret marriage should be discovered, one
day reached a climax.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will become of us?” cried Hildburg. “My father
will never forgive us. He will order us both to be slain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, at least, we shall die together,” replied Hugdieterich,
“but I hope for better things. The guards and your personal
attendants are on our side, and I expect Berchtung very soon
to come and take me home to Constantinople, on the plea that
my brother has forgiven me. I shall then send an ambassador
to ask for your hand in marriage; and when your father knows
our secret, he will not refuse his consent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Berchtung came as Hugdieterich had expected, and fetched
him away; but the wooing had to be put off till a more convenient
season, as war had broken out on the frontier, and the
emperor was obliged to take the field. Meantime Hildburg was
in greater danger at home than her husband in the midst of
battle. She had a son. He was born quietly in the tower, without
any one except the three faithful friends who guarded the
princess there knowing aught about it. It was not until
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
months after this event that the queen, her mother, sent to
say that she was coming to visit her daughter. She followed
almost on the heels of the messenger. The porter pretended
to have great difficulty in unlocking the door, and by the time
he succeeded, the watchman had smuggled the child down to
a safe hiding-place beside the moat. It was already evening,
so the queen spent the night with her daughter. When she
was gone next morning, the faithful servant hastened to where
he had hidden the child, and it was not to be found. After
long and anxious search, he returned to his mistress, and told
her that he had taken the boy to a nurse, who had promised
to bring him up carefully and well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after this, Berchtung arrived at Thessalonica to thank
the king in his master’s name for the reception he and his
family had given the princess, his sister, and to ask for the
hand of the Lady Hildburg, with whom the emperor had fallen
in love from his sister’s description. The king put off giving
any immediate answer to this request, and asked Berchtung to
a great hunt he intended to give in his honour on the following
day.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a lovely morning when the hunters set out for the
forest. They rode on cheerily, and had a good day’s sport. At
length chance led the king and Berchtung past the tower
where sad Hildburg spent her weary days in waiting for the
husband who came not. As they rode along, they discovered
the fresh track of a wolf leading towards a spring. They followed
the spoor, which led them to a den in a thicket close
by, and in the den was a strange sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the centre of the nest, and surrounded by a litter of wolf-cubs
so young as to be still blind, lay a beautiful child. He was
playing with the little wolves, pulling their ears, and chatting in
baby language such as only mothers and nurses can translate.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
But evidently his companions did not like his attentions, and the
mother-wolf’s ire was so roused against him, that it wanted very
little more to make her spring upon the child, and put a sudden
end to his play. The old wolf came up at the same moment,
so that the danger was much increased. Seeing this, the two
hunters flung their spears with so much skill as to kill both the
old wolves on the spot. Then the king lifted the baby in his
arms as gently as if it had been his own child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s very strange,” he said, “how much I feel drawn to this boy.
But he must be hungry, poor little man. My daughter’s tower is
close to here; we shall find some fresh milk there, and she will be
glad to see the little fellow; she is so fond of children, and seldom
gets a chance of seeing them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They walked on slowly, Berchtung carrying the child, while the
king examined the wolf’s track with great interest and attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here,” he said, “is it not strange? The tracks lead
straight from the den to the moat; I wonder if the wolf stole
the child from anywhere near this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fair Hildburg was not a little astonished when she heard her
father’s tale. She took the child in her arms, and at once
recognised him by a birth-mark on his arm in the shape of a red
cross. She struggled to conceal her feelings, and offered as calmly
as she could to take care of the child, and only begged her father
to send a nurse as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he got home, the king told the queen of his adventure,
and she was very curious to see the child. She sent for a nurse,
and accompanied her to the tower. Arrived there, the queen
sought her daughter, and found her busied with the child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How I wish,” said the queen, taking it in her arms, “that I
knew who the boy’s mother is! She must be in such distress.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” answered Hildburg; “but look at his clothes, how fine
they are! They show that he is of princely descent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
“Oh dear,” sighed the queen, “what a lucky woman I should
think myself if I had a grandson like that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hildburg could keep her secret no longer. She threw herself
into her mother’s arms, and told her, with many tears, that she was
secretly married to Hugdieterich, and that the child was theirs.
The queen was startled, angry,—but—it was done, and could not
be undone. It was at least a comfort to think that the child’s
father was a mighty emperor! She told her daughter she would
say nothing; but would think what was best to be done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walgund felt strangely attracted by the child. He came to the
tower almost every day to visit it and his daughter. On such
occasions the queen would tell him how much she wished for a
son-in-law and such a grandchild as this. She reminded him that
they might in their old age fall a prey to the barbarous tribes
in the neighbourhood, if they had not some young, strong man
to take their part, and added that in her opinion Hugdieterich
would not be amiss. In short, the queen prepared the way so well
that when Berchtung made his formal offer for the princess’ hand,
the king after slight hesitation gave his consent, on the sole
condition that Hildburg was not averse to taking Hugdieterich
as a husband. The queen then told her lord the whole story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonderful!” he exclaimed, too much astonished to be angry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hugdieterich arrived soon afterwards, and was publicly married
to the Lady Hildburg. After the wedding festivities were over, he
set out for Constantinople, accompanied by his beautiful wife, and
the little boy, who was named Wolfdieterich, in remembrance of
his first adventure.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the empress went Sabene, one of the notables of Thessalonica,
as her father had much confidence in his wisdom, and
wished him to be his daughter’s counsellor in any matters of
difficulty. He made himself so useful, that he soon became
necessary to her, and at the same time won the confidence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
honest Duke Berchtung so completely that he persuaded the
emperor to make Sabene regent during their absence on a foreign
campaign.</p>

<p class='c007'>The high position he had gained through the duke’s kindness,
made the false-hearted man bolder and more self-confident than
ever. One day he went so far as to speak unbecomingly to the
empress. The noble lady reproved him severely, and he fell at
her feet, begging her pardon, and entreating her not to tell the
emperor of his impertinence. She promised, but commanded him
never more to appear in her presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Hugdieterich returned victorious, Sabene was the first to
meet him. He gave him an account of his stewardship, and at last
remarked, as though by chance, that there was a great deal of
dissatisfaction amongst the people regarding Wolfdieterich, the
heir-apparent, who rumour said was not the king’s child, but the
son of an elf, or, worse still, of an alraun, who had been palmed
off upon the royal family by a witch. Hugdieterich laughed at
the story as at a nursery tale. The only effect it had on him was
to make him take his son from under the charge of Sabene, and
give him into the care of faithful Berchtung, that he might learn
all knightly exercises with the duke’s sixteen sons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Time passed on, and the empress presented her husband with
two other sons, named Bogen and Waxmuth, who were also sent
to Berchtung to be educated. The old duke loved all his pupils
dearly, but Wolfdieterich was his special favourite, for he showed
himself full of every quality that makes a true knight and noble
warrior. The busy emperor seldom found time to go to Lilienporte,
the castle of Meran, and Hildburg was a still less frequent
visitor, so that Wolfdieterich had grown accustomed to look upon
Berchtung as his father, and the duchess as his mother. His
brothers, Bogen and Waxmuth, had long since returned to
Constantinople, where crafty Sabene did all that he could to gain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
their friendship and confidence. Their mother was sorry to see it;
and fearing lest evil should come of it, she told her husband all
that had happened between them many years before. Hugdieterich’s
wrath blazed forth, and Sabene scarcely escaped alive.
He fled from the country, and sought refuge amongst his kindred
in the land of the Huns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hugdieterich, worn out by many anxieties and battles, grew
old before his time. When he felt his end approach, he arranged
all his affairs with the utmost care. He bequeathed to his
eldest son Constantinople and the larger part of the empire, while
the two younger sons were given kingdoms farther to the south,
and the empress and Berchtung were to see the will carried
out. But scarcely was the emperor laid in the grave, when the
notables of the land met in council, and demanded the recall
of Sabene, because otherwise they feared he might carry out his
threat of bringing the wild Huns upon them. The empress
did not feel herself strong enough to withstand the clamour of
the nobles, so she sent for the traitor.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Wolfdieterich and his Eleven.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>No sooner had Sabene returned than he began to scheme
again. He spread amongst the people his silly tales about
the origin of Wolfdieterich. He said that the empress had
been secretly wedded to an elf while she lived in that solitary
tower; and that it was elfish spells that had prevented the
wolves from tearing the child in pieces. The populace believed
the story the more easily from its utter incredibility, and demanded
that Wolfdieterich should remain at Meran. Sabene even succeeded
in making the royal brothers, Waxmuth and Bogen,
believe his tale, and give him the power for which he hungered.
Sure of his own position, he acted with the utmost harshness.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
He bade the empress leave the palace and go to her son at
Meran. He only allowed her to take with her a maid-servant,
a horse, and her clothes. Everything else that she possessed,
whether through her father or her husband, had to be left
behind. The two young kings did not interfere on her behalf,
for Sabene had shown them that her treasures would be very
useful to them in equipping an army, supposing Wolfdieterich
and the Duke of Meran attacked them.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Hildburg arrived at Hugelwarte, an outwork of Lilienporte,
she was travel-stained and sorely spent. At first Duke
Berchtung refused to admit her, because she had recalled
Sabene contrary to his advice. But at last, filled with pity
for the unhappy woman, he led her into the castle, and treated
her there with royal honours. The duchess received her surrounded
by seventeen young men, who all called her mother.
The empress did not at once recognise her son, who was the
tallest and stateliest amongst them; but as soon as each knew
the other, Wolfdieterich, throwing himself into her arms, tried
to comfort her by promising to restore her to her former rank
and splendour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Duke Berchtung at first counselled peace, because the position
of the two kings seemed to him so strong and unassailable;
but at length, carried away by his foster-son’s enthusiasm, he
not only gave his consent, but placed his sixteen sons and
their sixteen thousand followers at the disposal of the prince.
It was settled, while the men were being called together, that
the duke and Wolfdieterich should set out for Constantinople,
and see whether they might not attain their end by peaceful
means.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day after their arrival, they met Sabene and the kings
in council. Berchtung was received with all honour, while
nobody seemed even to see his companion. When Wolfdieterich
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
rose, and demanded his rightful share of the royal heritage,
Bogen answered that a changeling had no right to any share;
and Sabene added that he ought to apply to the alraun, his
father, for a kingdom in the realms of hell. Wolfdieterich laid
his hand on his sword; but his foster-father’s words and looks
of entreaty sufficed to calm him down and prevent any open
expression of anger. The kings and Sabene did their utmost to
persuade the duke to join their party, but in vain; and when the
council broke up, the old man went away, hiding his displeasure
as best he could. He and Wolfdieterich mounted their horses
and returned to Lilienporte without loss of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few days’ rest they set out again for Constantinople,
but this time in battle array. On reaching the borders of Meran,
they found the royal forces drawn up to meet them. As evening
was closing in, they encamped in a wide valley surrounded on
all sides by a forest. Next morning the troops rose refreshed,
and each side made sure of victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle-song was now raised, and echoed amongst the
mountains like rolling thunder. Next instant the armies met.
Wolfdieterich was always to be seen in front. All at once he
turned to Berchtung, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you see Sabene and my brothers on yonder hill? I will
go and see whether they or the alraun’s son are the better
men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words, he set spurs to his horse and dashed through
the enemy’s ranks. Old Berchtung, who had vainly tried to
restrain him, now followed with his sons and a small body
of his men-at-arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they neared the hill, they found themselves surrounded
by the Greeks on every side. The carnage was terrible. Six
of Berchtung’s sixteen sons fell at his side, while a stone struck
Wolfdieterich on the helmet, and stretched him senseless on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
the ground. But the old duke and his other sons picked him
up, and brought him safely off the field. All night long they
fled, and after resting only a few hours during the day, resumed
their journey. On their arrival at Lilienporte, they found that
many of their men had got there before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will await the traitors here,” said Berchtung. “They
may break their teeth on our stone walls, and then go away
worse than they came. We have supplies enough to last four
years, and can bid them defiance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after this, the enemy appeared before the fortress.
Sabene demanded that the prince should be delivered up to
them, and threatened that if this were refused he would burn the
castle and all within it. The only answer made by the besieged
was a sortie, led by Wolfdieterich in person. He still was hopeful
of victory, but numbers prevailed. He had to retreat, and
with difficulty regained the fortress. From that day he lost the
confidence and gaiety of youth, and became grave and silent;
his trust in the sure success of a righteous cause was gone. He
lost his faith in Divine justice, and said he had fallen a victim to
the resistless power that men call Fate.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Sigeminne.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The siege had already lasted three years, and yet there was
no hope of an end. The food had grown scanty; and if the
enemy chose to make famine their ally, the castle must finally
capitulate. The duke vainly sought for some plan of deliverance.
One day Wolfdieterich came to him, and said that he intended
to slip out of the fortress by night, make his way through the
enemy’s camp, and go to Lombardy, there to ask the help of
Ortnit, the powerful emperor of the West. The old man did
his best to dissuade the lad, reminding him that their provisions
would last yet a year, and that the enemy, already weakened
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
by sickness, might raise the siege before long. The young hero
was not to be held back: at midnight he took leave of his foster-father
and his other faithful friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May God protect you, my dear lord,” said Berchtung, clasping
him in his arms. “You will have to cross the deserts of Roumelia,
which are uninhabited, save by wild beasts and evil spirits. There
you will find Rauch-Else, who lies in wait for young warriors.
Beware of her, for she is a witch, cunning in enchantments. If
you are fortunate enough to reach the emperor Ortnit, do not
forget your trusty henchmen, me and my ten remaining sons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they parted. They arranged that the besieged should
make a sally through the principal gate of the fortress, to draw
off the enemy’s attention to that quarter, while Wolfdieterich
got away by a postern door at the back. He was nearly out
of the enemy’s camp when he was recognised. Immediately
mounting his horse, he drew his sword and cut his way through
their midst, and once in the dark forest beyond, he was safe
from pursuit. All night long Wolfdieterich rode through the
wood. He heard the were-wolves howling in the distance, but
none came near to seek his life. As morning broke, he found
himself by the side of a broad moorland lake. All sorts of
strange creatures rose out of it, and sought to bar the road. Two
of them he killed, but he let the others escape. He wandered
three days in the wilderness, finding nothing for his horse or
himself to eat. He shared the bread he had in his wallet with
his steed. It was but a little at best; and the faithful creature
was at last too exhausted to carry him farther, so he dismounted
and led it by the bridle.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the fourth evening, fatigue overpowered him so much that
he was forced to rest. He lighted a fire with the brushwood
scattered about. The warmth did him good, for a cold
mist hung over the face of the earth. He and his horse
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
quenched their thirst at a neighbouring rill, after which he lay
down, and making a pillow of his saddle, thought over his sad
fate. Sleep was beginning to steal upon his senses, when he
was suddenly roused by a noise in the dry grass. Something
black, and horrible to look upon, crept nearer and nearer. It
raised itself in the air; its height was appalling. It spoke
to him, not with a human voice; the sound was more like
the growling of an angry bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How dare you rest here!” said the monster. “I am Rauch-Else
(rough Alice), and this ground belongs to me; besides
which, I have another and a wider realm. Get up, and go at
once, or I will throw you into the quaking bog.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfdieterich would willingly have obeyed, but he was too
tired. He could not move. He therefore begged the bear-like
queen to give him something to eat, telling her that his cruel
brothers had deprived him of his inheritance, and that he was
now starving in the desert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you are Wolfdieterich,” growled the bear-woman. “Well,
Fate has marked you out to be my husband, so you may count
upon my aid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon which she gave him a juicy root, and scarcely had he
eaten one mouthful when his courage returned, and his strength
seemed tenfold what it had ever been before. It even came
into his mind that he could conquer the Greek forces single-handed,
and set his eleven faithful servants free. In obedience
to Rauch-Else’s command, he gave the rest of the root to his
horse, which first smelt it carefully, and then ate eagerly. No
sooner had it done so, than it began to paw the ground, and
neighed with eagerness to resume its journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speak, will you be my true love?” asked the bear-woman,
coming up to the youth, and preparing to clutch him to her
heart with her terrible claws.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
“Keep back,” he cried, drawing his sword. “Demon that
you are, seek a husband in hell, where alone you will find a
helpmeet worthy of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have I not fed and succoured you?” asked Rauch-Else;
“was that done like a demon? I have long waited for you
to come and free me from an evil spell. Love me, and save
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed to the warrior as if her voice had all at once grown
soft and human in its tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes,” he said, “if only you were not so rough and
hairy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had hardly spoken, when the black fleece slowly slipped
to her feet, and a beautiful woman stood before him, her brow
encircled by a diadem, and her green silken garment confined
at the waist by a jewelled belt. Her voice was sweet and
thrilling as she repeated her former words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speak, young hero, will you love me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>His only answer was to clasp her in his arms and kiss
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must know,” she said, “that although Rauch-Else was
my name here in the wilderness, I am really Sigeminne, queen
of Old-Troja. Your ‘yes’ has set me free from the spell of
the enchanter, so we can now set out for my country, of which
you shall be king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Full of joy and thankfulness, they started on their way,
followed by Wolfdieterich’s horse. At last they heard the
sound of waves breaking upon the shore, to which they soon
afterwards descended. There they found a curious vessel awaiting
them. The prow was formed of a fish’s head, large and
pointed. At the helm stood a merman, whose outstretched
arm was the handle by which the rudder, or fish’s tail, was
worked. Instead of sails, the vessel was rigged out with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
griffins’ wings, the advantage of which was, that they enabled
it to go against both wind and tide, when such a course was
thought desirable. The merman was so marvellously fashioned
out of cedar-wood from Mount Lebanon, that it could steer
wherever the travellers wished without their help. There were
other wonders on board the ship, such as a cap of darkness,
a ring with a stone ensuring victory to the wearer, a shirt of
palm-silk, and many other things. The shirt seemed as though
it would only fit a little child; but when Sigeminne put it
on her lover, it grew bigger and bigger, until it fitted him
exactly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take great care of it,” she said, “and wear it whenever
you are in any danger, for it will protect you alike from
steel and stone, from fire and dragon’s tooth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wafted by the griffins’ wings, the vessel clove the western
sea, swift as the wind, and soon brought the travellers to Old-Troja.
There the people received their beloved queen with
shouts of joy, and cheered loud and long when she introduced
the stately warrior Wolfdieterich as her future husband. The
marriage was solemnized with great festivities, and a life of
joy began for the new king. By the side of his fair wife he
forgot all his misfortunes and sorrows, and, alas! even the
Eleven Friends he had left in peril of their lives. Now and
then, when he was alone, the memory of all that had come
and gone would cross his mind like something he had dreamt,
and then he would reproach himself with neglecting his duty;
but Sigeminne had only to take his hand, and he once more
forgot that honour and duty alike bade him be up and doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once when he, his wife, and the whole court were out hunting,
a wondrous stag with golden horns broke out of a
neighbouring thicket. He did not seem to be afraid, but,
after looking at the hunters, turned back to the wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
“Up, good folk,” cried Sigeminne. “Whoever kills that stag,
and brings me the golden antlers, shall stand high in my
favour, and receive a ring from my own hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of huntsmen started in pursuit, first among them
Wolfdieterich. The stag led him by many devious paths,
only to disappear at last. Wolfdieterich returned to the tents
much disappointed. When he got there, he found all in
confusion; for that terrible magician, Giant Drusian, followed
by many armed dwarfs, had fallen on the camp during the
absence of the king and his warriors, and had carried off the
queen. No one knew where he had taken her to. Wolfdieterich
was now as much alone in the world, and as wretched, as he
had been that terrible day in the desert. One thought filled his
mind—the thought of Sigeminne. He would seek her through
the world; and if he could not find her, he would die!</p>

<p class='c007'>He exchanged his royal robes for a pilgrim’s dress, and
hid his sword in a hollow staff, which served to support him
on his journey. Thus accoutred, he wandered through many
lands, asking everywhere for the castle of Giant Drusian. At
length he learnt from a tiny dwarf, that the man he sought
lived in the lofty mountains far over the sea, and that many
dwarfs owned him for their lord. He set out again, and
journeyed on and on, till at length the castle came in sight.
He sat down to rest by a spring, and gazed longingly at the
place where, as he believed and hoped, he should find his
wife. His fatigue was so great that he fell asleep, dreamt of
her, and was happy in his dreams.</p>

<p class='c007'>All at once he was wakened by a rough voice, and a blow
on the ribs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, ho! pilgrim,” said the voice. “Have you snored
long enough? Come home with me, and have some food.
My wife wants to look at you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
Wolfdieterich sprang to his feet, and followed the giant who
had wakened him so roughly, and who now strode before him
to the castle. He knew that he had reached the end of his pilgrimage,
and entered the wide hall with thanksgiving and joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>There sat Sigeminne, her eyes red with weeping; and as
she looked at him, he saw that she knew who he was. He
pulled himself together with a violent effort not to betray his
identity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, wife,” growled Drusian, “there’s the priest you wanted
to see, that he might speak to you about his religion. What
a mite he is, to be sure, and as dumb as a lizard into the bargain!
There, bag-of-bones,” he added, turning to the pilgrim, “sit down
by the fire, and see if some of our good food will not warm your
thin blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The pilgrim did as he was desired, for, anxious and excited as
he felt, he was starving. Dwarfs brought in food and drink, and
he ate till his hunger was satisfied. The giant questioned him
up and down, and received short answers, some of them, it must
be confessed, far enough from the truth!</p>

<p class='c007'>As twilight deepened, Drusian seized the lady by the hand,
and pulled her from her seat, saying, “There, you see the son
of the alraun, who freed you from the bearskin, he will not
succeed in freeing you from me a second time. He fears a
broken skull too much. The term you asked for is over now,
so come with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He would have dragged Sigeminne from the room, but the
pilgrim had already thrown aside his disguise, and drawn his
sword from the hollow staff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Back, monster,” he shouted, “that is my wife.” With these
words he sprang upon the giant. The suddenness of the attack
made the latter jump back, exclaiming, “Why, alraun, are <em>you</em>
Wolfdieterich? If that is the case, we must have everything
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
fair and in order. You must arm and fight with me—if you
are brave enough, that is to say. Sigeminne shall be the wife
of the conqueror.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p>WOLFDIETERICH FIGHTS WITH DRUSIAN FOR HIS WIFE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The hero consented to fight the duel, and the dwarfs brought
him three suits of armour to choose from. One was of gold,
the second of silver, and the third of iron, very heavy, but old
and rusty. He chose the last, but kept his own sword.
Drusian also put on his coat of mail, and caught up his battle-axe.</p>

<p class='c007'>After some time, Wolfdieterich’s shield was broken by a
violent blow from his opponent’s axe. The hero seemed lost;
but avoiding the next blow, and grasping his sword with both
hands, he struck so hard a stroke that the sharp blade cut deep
down through neck and shoulder. Scarcely had the monster
fallen, when the dwarfs swarmed round the victor with their
small daggers and spears to avenge their master. The fine
needle-points pierced the rings of his armour, but the palm-silk
shirt protected the solitary warrior from every wound. At last
he forced them back, and husband and wife were able to clasp
each other’s hands, and to assure one another of a love that
would last till death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us away from this cursed house,” cried the hero; “who
can tell but the dwarfish rabble are spinning new toils for us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They hastened out into the deserted court, and then sought
a stable, in which they found two saddled horses. These they
mounted, and rode away.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a long and tiring journey, they reached Old-Troja,
where the return of the queen and her brave husband was
greeted with joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sigeminne ruled her people with a gentle hand, but justly
and firmly; no wonder, then, that they loved her. After her
return, she was even sweeter and more thoughtful for others than
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
she had ever been before; but she was pale and thin, and what
was worse, grew paler and thinner day by day. One evening,
when she and her husband were sitting alone together, she
raised her sweet face to his and said, “When I am gone, you
must go back to your own country and people, for then you
will be looked upon as a stranger and usurper here, and the
land might be wasted by civil war.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The thought of her death cut him to the heart, but he strove
to look cheerful for fear of distressing his wife. He redoubled
his anxious care of her, but all in vain: her doom was sealed.
He had been strong enough to conquer the giant and save his
wife, but he was powerless to save her now. She died in his
arms, and he laid her in her early grave.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Knife Man.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Once, when he was standing sadly by her last resting-place,
he suddenly remembered that she had bidden him go back to
his own country when she was dead; and then the thought of
his mother and his Faithful Eleven rushed back into his mind.
He also recollected that he had never carried out his plan of
calling the Emperor Ortnit to their assistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall never forget you, dear wife,” he murmured, “but I
should be unworthy of your great love for me if I did not at
once set out to bring freedom to those who have been true to
the death in their fidelity to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned away, and hastened to make ready for his journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>He passed through many lands, rich and poor. One evening
he saw a castle before him, and asked a passing traveller to
whom it belonged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir,” replied the man, crossing himself, “ride on quickly, if
you be a Christian, for that stronghold is where the heathen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
king Beligan lives, with his daughter Marpilia, a maiden learned
in magic arts. He slays every Christian he can catch, and
sticks his head on a spike placed on the battlements for the
purpose. Look, there is one place empty still; beware lest your
head be sent to fill it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero explained that he felt no fear of that, as his armour
was good, and he must have sharp weapons who sought to pierce
it. But the traveller assured him that the king so thoroughly
understood the art of dagger-throwing, that none could escape
from him alive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfdieterich and the man parted company. The former
would have ridden past the castle, had not the owner come out
to meet him, and invited him to spend the night with him; an
invitation the hero was far too brave a man to decline. The
daughter of his host, a young and beautiful girl, received him
at the gate, and led him into the hall. While they supped
together, Wolfdieterich, on being questioned, told them whence
he came, and whither he was going; and Beligan saw from his
answers that he was a Christian. The heathen king then
informed his guest, with a diabolical smile, that he had come
just in time to provide a head to make up the required number
on the battlements. Wolfdieterich understood what was meant,
but shewing no signs of fear, he raised his goblet to his lips,
and emptied it to the health of his host and his daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bedtime came, and Beligan, taking him aside, told him that
he had found grace in the eyes of his daughter Marpilia, and
that he might marry her if he liked, receiving both castle and
kingdom as her dowry, on one condition—that he would worship
Mahmet. Wolfdieterich asked for time to think over the proposal;
but the heathen smiled, and said—</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may have to-night to consider the plan; that is long
enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
He then offered him a goblet of wine, into which he had
secretly thrown a powder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drink, friend,” he said, “and you will sleep long and soundly
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero was on the point of obeying, when Marpilia, who had
re-entered, snatched the goblet out of her father’s hand, and
emptying it on the floor, exclaimed,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not so, father. I intend to teach the stranger better things
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She led her guest to his room, and said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have saved you from a great danger. My father was about
to give you a sleeping potion, that he might slip into your room
in the night and cut off your head, as he has already done to
many a Christian. I now offer you my hand and kingdom, if
you will only pretend to follow our faith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfdieterich thought of Sigeminne, and turning to Marpilia
did his best to convert her to his faith. They spent the
whole night talking on these subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning Beligan came, and invited his guest to join
him at breakfast, and after that, in a little game of throwing
the dagger, explaining that such was their custom. As soon as
breakfast was over, they went into the court, where the king’s
servants stood round them in a wide circle. The hero laid aside
his armour and sword as he was desired, and received a buckler
and three sharp and pointed daggers. The heathen took his
stand opposite, armed in like manner. The latter flung the
first dagger at his opponent’s foot, and he avoided it by springing
to one side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the beard of the Prophet,” cried the heathen, “who taught
you that? Are you Wolfdieterich, from whom it is foretold
that evil shall befall me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfdieterich would not confess to his name, but stood ready
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
again for the fight. The second dagger scratched his head,
carrying off a bit of the scalp; the third he caught on his
buckler.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was now the hero’s turn to throw. His first dagger pinned
the heathen’s left foot to the ground; the second scratched his
side; but the third, which he flung with the cry, “I am Wolfdieterich!”
struck him to the heart. He was now attacked on
all sides, but succeeded in putting his opponents to flight. He
then re-entered the castle, put on his armour, took his horse
out of the stable, and was about to mount, when he suddenly
saw that a wide lake surrounded the castle on every side, and a
gale of wind was blowing the great waves so high that there
seemed no chance of escape. At the edge of the water stood
Marpilia, describing circles in the air and on the ground with
a magic wand, and murmuring to herself the while. Riding up
to her, he caught her in his arms, and swung her before him on
his horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I am to drown, witch, you shall not escape,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words he spurred his horse into the wild waves,
and saw that the waters stretched out farther and farther, until
they seemed a sea. He looked around, and saw that only one
chance was left him. He flung the witch-woman off his horse;
instantly the storm ceased, the waters retired, and he was once
more on dry land.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Marpilia was not drowned. She appeared before him
again in all her beauty, stretching out her arms as if to embrace
him, but he threatened her with his drawn sword. Then she
changed into a magpie, flew to the top of a high rock, and sought
from thence to entangle him with new enchantments, each more
terrible than the other. At last, thoroughly spent with fatigue,
he exclaimed, “Help me, Thou Three in One, or I die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Scarcely had he uttered the words when the witch vanished,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
the sun shone once more upon mount and vale, and before him
lay the broad road that led to Lombardy.</p>

<p class='c007'>After meeting with many adventures by land and water, he
travelled through a wild mountain region, and there he fell in
with a giantess, an old friend of his father, who received him
very kindly, and told him, amongst other things, of the sad fate
of Ortnit and Liebgart. Although her tale diminished his hopes
of help, he was yet determined to continue his journey. The
giantess said it would take an eternity travelling as he did,
horses were so slow! With that she picked up both horse and
rider, and carried them pick-a-back on her broad shoulders three
hundred and fifty miles in one day, over mountains, valleys and
rivers, and set him down in the fair land of Lombardy.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Lind-Worm.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>It was a beautiful moonlight night when Wolfdieterich reached
Garden. He dismounted, and standing under the shadow of an
olive-tree, he looked about him. He saw two women walking
on the sea-shore. One of them was tall and stately. When
she threw back her veil, he nearly uttered a cry of astonishment,
she was so like Sigeminne. Had the grave given up its dead,
or had some deceitful elf taken the beloved form to lead him
into danger?</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood breathless to listen, and heard Queen Liebgart, for
it was she, complain to her serving-maid of the manifold
sorrows and indignities she had been forced to endure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The cowardly vassals!” she said. “They have courage
enough to frighten a weak woman, but no one dares to do the
only thing that I desire on earth—to avenge the death of their
king on the monster that killed him. And yet I have promised,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
although unwillingly, to give my hand to the true knight and
hero that will do this thing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is only one man,” said the maid, “who could do the
deed, and that is the Greek Wolfdieterich, whose fame is spread
abroad in every land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The avenger is come, great queen,” said the hero, stepping
out of the shade where he had stood. “I will venture my life
to conquer the dragon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two women started back in alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is Wolfdieterich!” cried the maid. “He once saved me
from a band of robbers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, noble hero,” said Liebgart, “and may Heaven protect
you on your quest! But—the monster will take your life as it
did my husband’s. Nay, go your way in peace, and leave me to
my fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But when the Greek showed her that his mind was firm,
Liebgart gave him a ring which the dwarf had told her would
bring good luck to the wearer, wished him all success, and then
returned to Castle Garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without more delay the hero turned his horse to the mountains,
and made the best of his way to the lind-worm’s hole,
which at length he reached. He peeped into the dark cavern,
and saw five dragons’ heads staring and hissing at him. These
were the young “worms”—the old one had gone out to seek
for food. The hero was about to slay them there and then, but
it suddenly occurred to him that it would be better if the old
worm knew nothing of his coming, and it would be an easy task
to kill the little ones when the mother was dead. So remounting
his horse, he set out in search of the monster. As he rode on
slowly, he saw a beautiful child standing on a rock. It called to
him,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are come to revenge my son Ortnit; beware that you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
sleep not, for if you sleep my son will remain unrevenged, and
you will fall a prey to the dragon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My good friend,” laughed the hero, “you are too young to
be a father. I advise you to look out for yourself. You would
be a sweeter morsel for the monster than I!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And setting spurs to his horse, he rode away laughing. Like
Ortnit, he came first to the high cliffs, and then to the meadow,
where clover grass and flowers grew in wonderful profusion. A
linden-tree shaded part of it from the heat of the mid-day sun.
The hero was tired after his long journey and wakeful night. He
stretched himself in the shade to rest, while his horse grazed in
the meadow. Fatigue, the fresh sweet air, and the song of the
birds in the branches overhead, all combined to make him drowsy,
so he gradually fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perfect peace reigned in the quiet spot. It seemed as though
it might last for ever, but suddenly it was broken by a horrible
hissing, a crashing of rocks and breaking of trees. The dreadful
monster, the terror of the land, was drawing near. At the same
moment Alberich exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wake, noble hero; sleep no more; the lind-worm is upon you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwarf repeated his warning several times in vain. The
faithful horse galloped up to his master, and kicked him, but he
did not awake. It was not until the dragon gave utterance to
a loud and hideous roar, that made the rocks crack and the
mountains tremble, that the hero was at last aroused from his
trance. He sprang to his feet and attacked the monster; but
his weapons were all too weak for the work they had to do—they
broke like reeds on the creature’s hide, without doing it any
injury. So he flung the handle of his broken sword in the
monster’s face, and commended his soul to God, for he was
defenceless. The worm caught him up in the coils of its long
tail, and at the same moment seized the horse in its great jaws.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
Then it bore its victims away to its den, and threw them down
as food for its young. After which, it went away again in search
of more food. The little dragons tried to devour Wolfdieterich,
but could not, he was so well protected by his shirt of palm-silk,
so they thrust him aside unconscious, and turned their
attention to the horse, which they soon disposed of.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the middle of the night Wolfdieterich came to himself, and
began to look about him carefully. The moonlight penetrated
the cavern, and showed him at a little distance something that
shone bright red. He moved towards it cautiously for fear of
waking the dragons, and found that the object which had
attracted his eye was a huge carbuncle in a sword-hilt. He at
once knew that this must be the sword Rosen, and took possession
of it, as well as of the rest of Ortnit’s armour that he
found lying uninjured amongst other coats of mail, which however
were all more or less broken. With the armour he found a ring.
This he put upon his finger. His preparations were no sooner
completed than daybreak came, and with it the old lind-worm.
He at once attacked her, and, thanks to the magic sword, slew
her and all her brood after a hard struggle. Thoroughly exhausted,
he threw himself under a tree, where he lay panting
and breathless. There Alberich found him, and revived him with
food and wine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the victorious hero set out on his return to Garden, he
went back into the dragon’s den to get the heads of the monsters;
but when he had cut them off, he found that they were
much too heavy to carry, so he contented himself with taking
their tongues. These he put in a leather bag that one of
Alberich’s dwarfs brought him for the purpose, and then began his
journey, which was made longer and more wearisome by having
to be done on foot. He often lost his way amongst the wild
mountains, and did not reach his destination for many days.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
When he got to Garden, he found the castle full of feasting
and mirth. Wondering much, he went to a pious hermit who
lived near, and asked him the meaning of what was going on.
From him he learnt that the Burgrave Gerhart had slain the
lind-worm, and was to be married to beautiful Liebgart that very
evening. Wolfdieterich then begged the holy man to lend him
priestly garments, and having received those that had formerly
belonged to brother Martin, the hermit’s predecessor, he put
them on over the armour he had found in the dragon’s cave,
and repaired to the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>He entered the great hall, and saw Burgrave Gerhart, nicknamed
“Hawk’s Nose,” seated next to the pale queen, who, with
her maidens, filled the glasses of the guests. Above the Burgrave’s
chair were the dragons’ heads, symbols of his victory.
When the queen saw the pretended hermit, she took him a cup
of wine, which he emptied at a draught, and then gave back, after
having slipped into it the ring she had given him on the evening
he started on his quest. Liebgart did not notice the ring till
she had returned to her seat by Gerhart’s side. Then she
trembled violently, but forcing down her emotion, she desired
the hermit to approach, and tell her from whom he got the ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady, you gave it me yourself,” he said, throwing aside his
disguise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every eye was fixed on him as he stood in the middle of the
hall, clad in Ortnit’s wondrous armour, and looking more like a
god than a mortal man. When, advancing to the queen, he laid
her husband’s ring in her hand, and told her how and where he
had found it, many voices cried, “Hail to the avenger of our
king, the slayer of the dragon and its brood! Hail to the new
king of Lombardy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Burgrave Gerhart was not to be put aside so easily. He pointed
to the dragons’ heads as proofs of his right; but when Wolfdieterich
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
produced the tongues from his wallet, there was no more to be said
but for Burgrave Gerhart to beg the hero’s pardon. This he
received on condition of swearing fealty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfdieterich was now proclaimed king of Lombardy, and was
told that he was expected to marry the queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lords,” he said, “as ruler of this kingdom, I am also the
servant of my people, and am bound to labour for their welfare.
But as regards personal matters, such as the choice of a wife, I
must be free, and the queen must also be free to choose as she
lists. She is yet mourning the loss of her first husband. But if
she holds me worthy to succeed him, and thinks that my love
and reverence will comfort her for his loss, I offer her my hand
for life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Liebgart, remembering what Ortnit had said to her, placed her
hand in the hero’s, and was married to him before long.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfdieterich was no longer the impetuous boy who had left
Lilienporte, but a man who could act with wisdom, prudence and
forethought. He felt that his first duty was to restore peace and
quiet to Lombardy, and that only after that was done would he
be at liberty to consult his own wishes, and start to the assistance
of his faithful servants. A year was spent in this labour, and
then he told his wife that he must go to Lilienporte. She wept
and said that she feared lest, like Ortnit, he should never return,
but in the same breath confessed that he was right, and helped
him to make ready for his journey and that of his army, which was
to number sixty thousand men.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Eleven.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Winds and waves were in their favour, and the army landed at
a short distance from Constantinople. Whilst the men encamped
in a wood, the king set out in peasant’s clothes to pick up all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
news he could learn. After spending hours wandering about the
city, and hearing nothing that was of any use to him, he chanced
to meet Ortwin, a gaoler, and a former acquaintance of his. The
man carried a basket filled with black bread. The hero went to
him and asked him to give him a loaf for Wolfdieterich’s sake.
The man looked at him keenly, and recognised him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, sire,” he said, “things have gone badly here with us. The
good old empress died during the siege of Lilienporte. When the
fortress capitulated, the noble duke Berchtung and his sons were
put in irons and flung into a dark and dismal dungeon. Death
soon put an end to the old man’s pain, but the ten young lords are
still kept in strict confinement, and I may bring them no better
food than a daily supply of this black bread and water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfdieterich was miserable when he thought that he was not
without guilt with respect to his mother and his old friend. He
could do nothing for them now, but he might still do something
for the ten faithful servants who yet remained. He arranged
with Ortwin that they should have better food, and should be
cheered by the hope of a speedy deliverance. The old gaoler
went on his way, and the king returned to his people.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found his men already under arms, for they told him that
Sabene had discovered not only that they were there, but what
had brought them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The armies met, and the battle raged long and furiously, without
either side getting the better of the other. But at last the
fortune of the day turned. The citizens of Constantinople rose in
revolt against the tyranny that had ground them down so long,
hastened to the prison, and set Berchtung’s ten brave sons at
liberty. Having done this, they put themselves under their
command, and marched to the assistance of Wolfdieterich. It
was a glorious victory. The hero was proclaimed emperor on
the battle-field.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
Soon after their return to the capital, Sabene and the royal
brothers were brought before their judges. The first was sentenced
to death, and was at once led away to instant execution; the death
of the two latter was likewise demanded by both people and army,
and Wolfdieterich knew that they were guilty of causing the death
of their mother and that of old Berchtung, and had brought upon
him all the troubles and difficulties of his early youth. Yet he
could not decide what was best to be done, and reserved judgment
until the following day.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night, as the victor slept the sleep of the just, his mother
appeared to him in a dream, saintlike and beautiful in aspect. She
said: “Spare my children, and my blessing shall rest on thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And immediately Berchtung appeared at her side: “God
has mercy upon His erring children; do not shed thy brothers’
blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the hero gazed at the apparitions in intense amazement,
Liebgart joined them, and said gently: “Hast thou not gained
kingdom, glory, and me, through the ill deeds of thy brothers?
Return them, therefore, good for evil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning broke—the figures vanished, leaving Wolfdieterich
resolved what he should do. He called the nobles together, and
before them all pardoned Bogen and Waxmuth, restored them
their dignities and lands, to be held thenceforth as great fiefs
under him. At first no one approved of his clemency, but on
hearing his explanation all were silenced.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as his arrangements were completed, Wolfdieterich
returned with his army to Lombardy, and was welcomed by
Liebgart with the greatest joy. After resting there for awhile, he,
his princes, and their followers went to Rome, where he was
crowned emperor. At the feast which followed the coronation he
appointed the ten sons of good Duke Berchtung to be rulers of
great fiefs. Herbrand, the eldest, received Garden and its territory.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
Through his son Hildebrand, of whose valiant deeds we shall hear
later on, he was the ancestor of the Wülfings. Hache was given
Rhineland, with Breisach as his capital. His son Eckehart was
the protector of the Harlungs, Imbreke, and Fritele. He is
celebrated in song and story as the trusty Eckehart. Berchther,
the third son, succeeded his father at Meran. The other sons were
as well endowed, but not as famous as their brothers, so their names
and possessions need not be told.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfdieterich and Liebgart had a son, whom they named
Hugdieterich after his grandfather. He grew up to be a mighty
hero, and was the father of a valiant race.</p>

    <h3 id='p1c2s2' class='mt'>II.<br />
    KING SAMSON (SAMSING).</h3>

<p class='dc5'>In the good old times a mighty
yarl (earl) ruled over the rich
town and district of Salern,
which was one of the largest fiefs of a great kingdom. The yarl
governed so strictly and justly that peace and plenty cheered the
hearts of all that dwelt in the district. He kept up a large army
to defend his coasts from the onslaught of the Vikings, who
often descended on them in great numbers in hopes of plunder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst the followers of the yarl was the warrior Samson,
nicknamed “The Black,” because of his coal-black hair and beard.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
He was always the first in battle, and had even been known to
disperse whole battalions with his single arm. He was terrible
to look upon. His dark eyes flashed under heavy beetling brows.
His bull-neck and powerful limbs bore witness to his remarkable
strength. No one could withstand him in battle. He hewed men
down, whether armed or unarmed, with as great ease as if they
were made of touchwood. In private life, on the other hand, he
was gentle and kindly, unless contradicted; then, indeed, he would
keep silence, but would none the less carry out his own will, regardless
of the cost to others. As can be readily imagined, few people
ventured to oppose him without reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day the yarl, who had just been made king, was sitting at
a feast in celebration of a great victory. His warriors were round
him sharing in his joy, Samson in their midst. Suddenly he rose,
and, taking a cup of wine in his hand, offered it to the king, and
said, with all courtesy:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire, many a victory have I helped to gain for you, and
now I come to offer you this cup and to ask you to grant me
a boon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speak on, brave hero,” answered the king, “and tell me what
you desire. Hitherto you have asked no reward for your great
deeds of valour. What you already have was given of my good
will, unasked by you. So demand what you like, I can deny you
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good, my lord,” said Samson. “I do not want any more castles
or lands, I am rich enough; but I am very solitary at home, now
that my mother has grown old and cross. Your daughter Hildeswid
is a sweet little thing, and I should much like to make her my
wife. Now you know how you can pleasure me by granting this
request.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rodgeier was so astonished at this address that he nearly let
the cup fall.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
“You are a famous warrior,” he said; “but the maiden is of
royal birth, and only a king can lead her home. You are in her
service as well as mine. So take this plate of sweetmeats and
bear it to her in the women’s house. Then come back here, and
drown all memory of your strange request in a bowl of good
wine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Samson took up the sweetmeats silently, and bore them to the
princess, who was busy embroidering with her maids. He placed
the dish before her, saying,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eat, sweet one, for I bring you good news. You are to follow
me to my home, and live there as my good wife. Dress now, and
bid one of your maidens come with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On seeing the girl’s hesitation, he added,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you do not go willingly, you will force me to kill the yarl,
and burn the palace, with all that are in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked so fierce and grim as he spoke, that Hildeswid
trembled with fear, and obeyed him without a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took her by the hand and led her down to the court, where
a groom was holding his horse in readiness. In the clear light
of day, and in the presence of many watchmen, none of whom
dared remonstrate, Samson placed the princess before him on
the saddle, and rode away with her into the wood and towards
his home. When he reached his dwelling the door was locked,
and he knocked so thunderously that the sound was heard to a
great distance. No answer. He knocked again and again. A
hoarse voice at last was heard from within, proclaiming that the
door should not be opened whilst the owner of the house was
from home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother,” cried Samson, “pull back the bolts, for it is I—your
son—I have brought you a princess to be your daughter,
and to tend you in your old age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The door opened, creaking and groaning, as though unaccustomed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
to move on its hinges, and a thin old woman came
out on the threshold, dressed in rags.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” she cried. “Do you bring guests with you? That
woman in her grand clothes, her maid, and an idle groom. How
could you do it, son? You know how poor we are;” and she
looked up at her tall son with a cunning leer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, mother,” said the warrior, “where is the gold I sent you?
Where are the servants I gave you? And what have you done
with the gorgeous raiment I sent to clothe you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hid the gold away in my chest,” answered the old woman;
“for one never knows whether one may not become a pauper
in one’s old age. I dismissed the servants you gave me very
soon, for I thought they would have eaten me out of house and
home; and as for the clothes, I have laid them aside to wait for
better times.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah well, mother,” said Samson, “if that sort of thing makes
you happy, you can do as you like with your own; but now open
the door and let us in. We are tired after our long ride, and
would fain have a good dinner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went into the house and sat down. The old woman
placed before them a hunch of rye bread and a jar of water.
Samson would have made but a poor meal, had his groom not
brought out a cut of venison and some wine, with which he had
taken care to provide himself before leaving the palace. After
he had stilled his hunger, Samson begged his lady’s permission to
go out and see if he could not find a stag to store the larder.
The groom went down to the cellar, where he was fortunate
enough to find a cask of ale; and the old mother withdrew to her
own apartments, leaving the princess alone with her maid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wide hall was dark and eerie, and full of strange flickering
shadows, that grew more mysterious and ghost-like as the evening
closed in, and the owls might be heard hooting in the pine-trees

near. Hildeswid could bear it no longer. She sent her maid
to ask the old woman to come back to the hall; but she did not,
nor did the maid return. The poor child’s terror was so great
that she determined to go in search of her mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c007'>She wandered through one empty, dreary, dusty room after
another, till at last she entered a large vaulted chamber, and
there she saw the old woman crouching over a great chest full of
gold and precious stones, muttering to herself. Approaching her,
Hildeswid heard her gloating over her treasures, and saying how
much they would be increased when she added the princess’s
ornaments to the number, which could so easily be done by
strangling the girl. Hildeswid uttered a low cry of terror, and
the old woman looked round. Then, with a shriek of “thief,
robber, wretch!” she threw herself upon the unhappy child, and
tried to throttle her; but at that moment Samson came in and
stopped her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother,” he said, “you cannot remain here. I will take you
and your treasure to my other house on the edge of the wood.
There you can live in peace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile King Rodgeier had discovered that his daughter had
been carried off. He sent out one body of his men-at-arms after
another to fetch her home; but they all failed, and he prepared
to go himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Riding along towards Samson’s grange, he and his men saw a
little house by the side of a great wood. They entered, and asked
the old woman they met in the house to tell them where Samson
lived. She denied that she had ever heard of such a man; but
when the king offered her a handful of gold, she at once pointed
out the path that led to his grange, and even went a bit of the
way to see that they made no mistake.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king and his fifteen companions had not gone very far
when they met the hero. His helmet and armour were coal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
black, like his beard and hair; his steed was also black, but on
his shield was emblazoned a lion on a golden field. There was a
sharp, short fight in which Samson came off conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the battle was over, he set out for his mother’s house.
On entering the hall he found her there busily counting the gold
the king had given her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother,” he said, “for the sake of that gold you betrayed your
own son, and you richly deserve to die; but as you are my
mother, I cannot punish your treachery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old woman went on counting her hoard as calmly as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother,” he began again, “you betrayed your son for gold,
and you should die by my dagger; but you are my mother, and
I cannot slay you. Now listen to me: take your gold and leave
this place, lest harm befall you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old woman poured her treasures into a huge sack, and
answered,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“This should all have been yours, if you had not brought that
little fool into the house. I will go, and take my wealth to the
king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have slain him and his men,” said Samson quietly; but he
looked so stern that his mother changed colour, and muttered,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well then, I will go and seek an heir who will give both
me and my treasures house-room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Three times Samson’s hand sought sword and dagger, but he
mastered his anger, and rode away through the dark pine forest
to his home.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he got there, he found Hildeswid hard at work with her
maidens.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wife,” he said, going up to her, “my mother betrayed me for
love of gold—my sword and dagger both thirsted for her blood—but
I would not, could not slay her. If <em>you</em> are false to me—then—they
<em>must</em> do their work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
He looked terrible in his wrath, but she took off his helmet and
coat of mail, kissed him and led him to his seat. And he at once
grew gentle, and told her that he wanted to win glory and honour
for her sake, and that he hoped soon to see her acknowledged
queen of her father’s realm.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the death of Rodgeier was made known in Salern by the
only one of his men who had escaped to tell the tale, a Thing was
summoned in order that a new ruler might be chosen. The votes
were all in favour of Brunstein, brother of the late king, a man of
great wisdom in counsel, and a lover of justice. There would now
have been peace in the realm, had it not been for Samson, who
made raids into the land and carried off cattle and supplies. So
Brunstein called together all the bravest warriors of his own
and other lands, and made them lay their hands in his and swear
to take Samson alive or dead, or themselves die in the attempt.
Then, led by the king, they set out and rode over mountains and
plains and through the dark forest, and all without finding the
object of their search. One evening they reached a strong fortress,
and being very tired, rested there for the night. After
supper they went to bed and slept. Every one slept, even the
guards, when they had carefully locked and bolted the great
gates.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night Samson came. Finding he could not break the
gates, he set fire to them, and while they were still burning,
pulled them down, and leaped into the place. The watchmen
awoke and blew their horns; but as there were many thatched
roofs within the walls, all of which caught fire, the king and
his men naturally thought a large army had broken in upon
them, and were filled with terror. The gigantic figure of Black
Samson appearing now here, now there, amongst the flames,
added to their fear, and all that were left of them took refuge
in flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
The king, followed by six faithful attendants, made his way
into the forest, and after riding a long time came in sight
of a goodly grange. He entered, and found that the mistress
of the house was his niece Hildeswid. He asked after Samson,
but she said he was out. He then begged her to leave her
husband and go with him; but she refused, advising him to
go away as quickly as he could, lest he should fall into his
enemy’s hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brunstein confessed that she was right, and took his departure,
but it was even then too late. Samson had returned,
and, seeing them, at once set out in pursuit. No courage or
strength, however great, could avail against his terrible arm.
Brunstein and five of his warriors fell never to rise again, while
the sixth got away with great difficulty and not without severe
wounds. Samson started in pursuit. When he got out of
the wood, he saw thirty horsemen galloping towards him. On
their banner, a lion was displayed on a golden field.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, ho,” cried the hero, “you are Amelungs. Welcome,
Uncle Dietmar. I rejoice to see you and your men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When they had rested and refreshed themselves in Samson’s
grange, Dietmar explained, that having heard that his nephew
was outlawed and in need of help, he had come to visit him
and see whether he could be of any use. Samson was much
pleased, and announced his intention of taking the open field
now that he was no longer alone in the world. So he and
his companions set out next morning. No one ventured to
oppose him, and he soon had so large a district under his
command that he was able to take up the powers and dignity of
duke. After that he made his way towards Salern, and sent on
messengers to desire the citizens to elect him king, under pain
of having their town and possessions burnt about their ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>After much conferring together, the burghers came to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
conclusion that they could not do better than obey; for while
Samson had been their friend, their town had been more
flourishing than at any other time. So they sent to beg him
to come and rule over them.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the hero found that all was going as he wished, he
sent for his wife, and, side by side, they rode into Salern, where
they were received with acclamation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new ruler governed with a strong hand, and administered
justice equally to all, both high and low. He showed a grateful
remembrance of every kindness he had met with in his adversity,
and kept peace on his borders. He grew old in the punctual
fulfilment of these duties; and when he felt that he was no
longer strong enough to do the work alone, he appointed his
eldest son to be his assistant and successor. But he did not
like it to be supposed that he was too old and weak to be
of use; and so when his second son asked him what share he
was to have in the royal heritage, he answered him nothing, but
called together the whole army and made them an address.</p>

<p class='c007'>He told them that when he was young every one had sought
to do great deeds, but now people had grown lazy. The long
peace, that had brought material blessing on the realm, had
also brought the curse of a love of ease and pleasure; and for
fear this evil should increase, and the country become an easy
prey to some greedy neighbour, he summoned every warrior
to appear before him in three months’ time, each accompanied
by his men, and bearing a courageous heart within his breast,
for he was going to lead them against a powerful foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same day that Samson made this announcement to his
army, he wrote a letter to the proud yarl Elsung of Bern
(Verona), a man of about his own age, and with an equal
love of great and heroic deeds. In this letter he demanded
that Elsung should pay him tribute as his liege lord, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
should give his daughter, Odilia, to his second son. All this
he demanded as a right, due from a vassal to his king.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the yarl read the letter, he was very angry, and made
immediate preparations for war. He began by ordering five
of Samson’s ambassadors to be hung on the spot, and the sixth
to be sent back to his master with his tongue cut out.</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner were the three months over than King Samson
started for Bern at the head of his men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The armies met, and there was a great battle. The slaughter
on either side was hideous. At length Samson’s wondrous
strength enabled him to slay the yarl, and gain the victory.
The Bernese, seeing that their ruler was dead, thought it most
prudent to choose Samson for their king, and thus put an end
to all ill-feeling between the two nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this business was settled, the victor sent for the yarl’s
daughter, Odilia, and told her that he intended her to be the
wife of his second son, to whom he was going to make over
her father’s realm. The maiden wept, and said that she could
not marry so soon after her father’s death; but Samson’s rage
at meeting with contradiction was so terrible, that the girl in
mortal fear consented to wed the prince. His berserker wrath
appeased by her obedience, the king at once regained his usual
genial manner, kissed her, and assured her of his protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marriage arranged, Samson set out on his return to his
own land, accompanied by his eldest son. Before he had gone
very far, he felt his wounds painful. They would not heal,
and caused him so much suffering that he had to halt at a
little town on the way, and there he died, naming his youngest
son ruler of the Rhineland, with Fritilaburg as his residence.</p>

<h3 id='p1c2s3' class='c020'>III. DIETWART.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >There was once an emperor of Rome (Romaburg) called
Dietwart. His name was known far and wide for his
great deeds. At last, wishing to marry, he sent an embassy
to King Ladmer of Westenmer to ask for the hand of his
daughter. Ladmer professed himself highly honoured that so
great an emperor should wish to be allied with his house,
and begged that Dietwart would come to Westenmer and see
the princess; that done, the two young people might make
up their minds whether they were suited to each other.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
Dietwart consented, and after a stormy passage arrived at
his destination, accompanied by a hundred of his bravest
warriors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ladmer received his guest with all courtesy, and told him
how glad he would be to have him for a son-in-law, but that
the choice of a husband lay with the princess herself, for he
would never constrain his daughter to marry against her will.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the feast given in his honour, Dietwart dressed himself
like his men; but the princess, whose duty it was to offer
wine to her father’s guests, soon saw which was which, and
filled his goblet first. That evening her father asked her what
she thought of the stranger, and she replied,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“He seems to be a great prince, but I do not know his
ways; and until I know that they are pleasant in my eyes, I
will not marry him, as I might be very unhappy far away
from all I love, in a foreign land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her father kissed her, and told her she must do as she
pleased, but in his heart of hearts he hoped she would say
“yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A great hunt was arranged for the following day, the object
of which was the destruction of a number of stags, for they
had grown so numerous that they had done a great deal of
mischief in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it happened that Princess Minnie was a mighty huntress,
so she begged her father to let her join him on that day also,
for she loved the sport, and, as he knew, her arrow could reach
its goal as surely as that of any man. Dietwart did not much
relish seeing her so employed. He thought it was not maidenly,
and confided to his friends that he would rather seek
a wife among the daughters of the great princes at home,
than wed such a hoyden as the Lady Minnie. But however
that might be, it was his duty, and theirs, as men, to see
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
that the giddy girl got into no danger through her foolhardiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they were going down a narrow glen, Minnie wounded a
splendid stag, and the dogs set out in pursuit; while the princess,
drawing another arrow from her quiver, hastened after
them. Suddenly the dogs set up a simultaneous howl, and
rushed out of the thicket. The ladies of the court shrieked
aloud. “The worm,” they cried, “the lind-worm! Come back,
Lady Minnie, come back!” and at the same moment, turning
quickly, they fled across the valley, and took refuge on the
top of a neighbouring hill.</p>

<p class='c007'>A frightful hissing, cracking and trampling was heard, and
the dragon crept out of the thicket, its jaws wide open, ready
to seize its prey. It was a sight to make the bravest man
tremble. Princess Minnie shot three arrows, one after the other,
straight at the monster; but they glanced harmless off its
horny scales. She turned to fly, but her foot caught in a
branch, and she fell to the ground. She seemed lost, for the
dragon was making ready to spring upon her. Dietwart and
his men were close at hand. The latter threw themselves on
the worm; while the former took his stand before the girl to
defend her. It was a horrible sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lances, swords, arrows were no defence. They could not
pierce the monster’s scales, and one brave man after another
was caught in its claws, or was torn by its terrible teeth,
which in shape resembled the anchors of a ship. Dietwart
rushed to the assistance of his friends. He struck at the lind-worm’s
neck with his lance, but the point slipped from the
scales, and the dragon tore his breast with its claws. It
opened its great jaws as wide as it could, to seize and devour
him; but the hero thrust the shaft of his spear into its
gigantic mouth, and worked it round and round with such force
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
that the point came out at the other side. A stream of poison,
and flames of fire issued from the creature’s nostrils, and
the hero fell fainting to the ground, the dying monster on the
top of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietwart was roused from his insensibility by feeling himself
violently shaken. When he opened his eyes, he saw the
princess struggling to free him from the dragon’s body. Some
woodmen came up and helped her. When at last he rose to
his feet, he was so weak that he could not stand; and the
men made a litter of wattled boughs, on which they carried him
to the palace. The wound on his chest was carefully bound
up, and no one thought much of it, because the flesh alone
had been torn; but it festered badly, and the edges turned
black, as though they had been burnt. The doctors declared
that some of the dragon’s poisonous breath had touched it, and
they feared for the hero’s life. The king, the court, nay the
whole country, mourned for the man who had rid them of the
monster.</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning, as Dietwart lay sunk in a feverish doze after
the intense pain of the night, he felt a hand busied about his
wound. Strange to say, the hand felt both softer and gentler
than that of the doctor. He opened his eyes, and recognised
the princess. He watched her carefully remove the bandages,
and drop some liquid from a bottle into his burning wound.
The pain at once left him. He would have thanked her, but
she signed to him to be silent. After she had replaced the
bandages, and motioned to the nurses to be still, she went
away as gently as she had come. The wounded man felt as
free from pain as if an angel had brought him some of the
water of life. He fell into a quiet slumber. At night the pain
returned, but the next morning Minnie came back, and poured
balm into his wound. On the third morning she came again.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
He felt so much stronger, that he could not refrain from seizing
her hand and pressing it to his lips. She withdrew it gently,
and went away signing to him once more to hold his peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor rejoiced at the rapid recovery of his patient.
When told what had happened, he said that the royal maid
had received the miraculous balm from her mother on her
death-bed, and that she was forbidden to use it except in cases
of great necessity, and for those she loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For those she loved?” repeated the hero; and he felt
strangely happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he was well again, he one day met her alone in
the garden, and told her of his love. They talked together
for a long time; and when good King Ladmer heard of their
engagement, he gave them his blessing. The marriage feast
was soon afterwards held, and there, in the middle of the table,
as one of its greatest ornaments, was one of the dragon’s teeth
set in silver—a nice little tooth it was, weighing at least half
a hundred weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The husband and wife set out for Rome. The winds and
waves favoured them, and they soon reached Dietwart’s native
land. The legend informs us that they lived very happily
together for four hundred years, and had forty-four children, of
whom one son, Sigeher, alone survived them. But it does not
tell us whether the Lady Minnie took kindly to her household
duties, or always remained fonder of field sports than of needlework.</p>

  <h2 id='p1c3' class='c005'><i>DIETRICH OF BERN.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 id='p1c3s1' class='c020'>I. DIETRICH AND HILDEBRAND.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Dietmar, second son of Hugdieterich, ruled with a strong
hand at Bern, and refused to acknowledge his elder
brother Ermenrich, or any other king as his suzerain. He was
a mighty warrior, and so terrible in battle that few of his
enemies dared look him in the face. But at home he was
gentle to all, especially to his wife Odilia, daughter of Elsung,
or, according to another saga, daughter of a Danish king. His
eldest son, Dietrich, was the joy of his heart. At twelve years
old the lad had the strength of a mighty warrior. His fair hair
fell over his shoulders in heavy curls. His figure was tall and
slender, yet strong and well-knit. He had regular features, but
when he was angry, he was terrible to look upon. From his
earliest childhood any one might see that he would become a
lion-hearted hero. It was even said that his breath was like
glowing fire when he was angry, and this the people thought
an undoubted proof that he was descended from a demon
ancestor.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dietrich was five years old, a famous hero came to his
father’s court. This was Hildebrand, son of Herbrand, and
grandson of the faithful Berchtung. As we said before,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
Herbrand’s fief consisted of the district and castle of Garden.
He had brought up his son in the traditional way, so that he
grew up to be a perfect warrior, and a wise man. King Dietmar
was so pleased with his guest that he appointed him to be his
son’s teacher and governor. This was the beginning of a friendship
between master and pupil that lasted till death parted
them.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Sword Nagelring.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Now it came to pass that a giant and giantess invaded
Dietmar’s land; and slew, burnt, and plundered the people.
They were so strong that no one could resist them. The king
went against them at the head of an army; but could not
find them. He saw everywhere on his borders the desolation
they had caused; but none could tell him where they were concealed.
At this ill-success young Dietrich and his master were
as much distressed as the king himself. They determined to
search for the giants till they found them, though the search
should cost them years.</p>

<p class='c007'>They wandered over mountains and valleys seeking the
monsters, but seeing nothing of them. One day they set out to
hunt with their hawks and hounds, and came to a great forest,
in the middle of which was a green meadow, where they
thought they should find plenty of game. They uncoupled the
hounds, and rode, one to the left and the other to the right
of the meadow, holding their weapons in readiness. As Dietrich
slowly advanced, keeping a sharp look out, a dwarf crossed his
path. Stooping from his horse, he caught up the mannikin
and placed him in front of him. The little prisoner made so
loud a moan, that Hildebrand heard him, and galloped across
the meadow to see what was the matter. Catching sight of
the dwarf,—</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
“Hillo!” he cried. “Hold the rascal tight. He knows all
roads, both on, and under the earth. He is Elbegast, the
prince of thieves, and is certain to be a friend of the robbers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwarf shrieked louder than before, and declared that far
from being their friend, he had suffered much wrong at the hands
of the giant Grim and his sister Hilde, that he had even been
obliged to forge for them the good sword Nagelring, and the
strong helmet Hildegrim, and had been forced to lead them to
their victims by hidden ways known only to himself. He swore
to help the warriors if they wished to fight the unholy pair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mannikin was therefore set at liberty. He drew a long
breath, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You could not catch me now, if I wished to escape you;
but I will serve you faithfully, that I may be freed from the
power of the giants. Come back to this place at day-break
to-morrow, and I will give you the sword Nagelring, without
which you cannot conquer the monster. I shall steal it from
him as truly as I am Elbegast, the prince of thieves. Then I
will show you his foot-marks in the dewy grass, that you may
track him to his hollow mountain, where, if you slay him and
his wicked sister, you will find rich booty to reward you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwarf had no sooner uttered these words than he vanished.
The next morning, before daylight, the prince and his companion
came to the edge of the green meadow talking of this and
that. They agreed that the word of a mountain goblin was
not to be trusted, and that thievish Elbegast would probably
be false like all his kindred. Their conversation was interrupted
by a strange clanking sound, and at the same moment they
noticed the rosy dawn overspreading the sky. They started to
their feet, and looked about. Elbegast came up to them dragging
a huge sword. Dietrich seized it with a cry of joy, unsheathed
it and swung it in the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
“Now,” cried Elbegast, “you have the strength of twelve
men, and can fight the monster on equal terms. Look carefully
and you will see the marks of his shoes distinctly printed on
the dewy grass. I had to make his shoes of iron for he is
miserly, and said that leather was too dear. Follow the tracks,
and they will lead you to the entrance of his cave. I can go
with you no farther.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He vanished, and the heroes followed the giant’s tracks in
obedience to the dwarf’s advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length they reached a great cliff, but there was no opening
to be seen large enough to serve as a door. A few cracks
might be noticed here and there in the stone, so small that only
a dwarf or a lizard could have crept in; certainly not a man in
armour, and still less a giant. Hildebrand thought that a bit
of the rock might perhaps be fitted into the cliff instead of a
door. He tried to shake and loosen any projecting piece of the
cliff that he could clutch. His efforts were not in vain. An
enormous block of stone stirred and rocked beneath his hands,
and just as Dietrich came to his assistance, it fell thundering
into the valley below. The sunlight penetrated the darkness of
a deep cavern, in the background of which a great fire was
burning. Grim was lying on a bed of bear and wolf skins
close to the flames. Wakened by the falling rock, he raised
himself on his elbow, and perceiving the warriors’ approach,
looked about for his sword; not finding it, he snatched up a
burning log, and rushed upon Dietrich. His blows sounded
like claps of thunder, and fell as thick as hail; it was only
the young warrior’s nimbleness that saved his life, which was
endangered not only by the force of the blows, but by the
smoke and the burning sparks that flew from the log. Hildebrand
would have gone to his pupil’s assistance had not the latter
forbidden him. And indeed he soon had enough to do to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
defend himself, for the giantess now appeared, and catching
Hildebrand up in her arms, held him tight. It was a deadly
embrace. The warrior could not breathe. He struggled in vain
to free himself from the sinewy arms that held him. At last
the giantess threw him on his back, pressing his hands and
arms as though in a vice, and making the blood spirt from
under his nails. She looked about for a rope with which to
bind and hang him. Hildebrand called to his companion to
help him in his need. Dietrich seeing his friend’s danger leaped
over the giant’s weapon with a despairing spring, and at the
same time seizing his sword in both hands, split the monster’s
head from the crown to the collar-bone. Then turning upon
the giantess, he slew her after a short but sharp engagement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hildebrand now staggered to his feet, and said that from
henceforth he would regard his former pupil as his master, because
that woman had been harder to deal with than any foe
he had ever met before. Dietrich and Hildebrand took the
treasure they found hidden away in a side cave, as their meed
of victory, and brought it home to Bern.</p>

<p class='c007'>King Dietmar rejoiced in the glory of his heroic son,
whose name had become famous in every land; but he did
not live long after these events. He died loved and honoured
by all. When Dietrich ascended the throne, he gave his young
brother Diether into Hildebrand’s charge, begging his friend to
teach the boy to be a hero and a worthy scion of his noble
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Hildebrand did his best, with the help of his wife, the
good high-souled Ute (Uote), whom he married soon after. Together
they taught the boy to love what was good and true,
to be brave, and to be not only an admirer but a doer of high
deeds.</p>

<div class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
<span class='sc'>Sigenot.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Soon after Grim and Hilde had fallen under Dietrich’s sword,
their nephew, strong Sigenot, a giant who lived in the Western
Mountains, came down into the forest to visit his relations.
When he discovered their dead bodies in the cave, he howled
with rage and swore to avenge their death. A dwarf for whom
he called told him of the fight between his uncle and aunt and
the heroes, but Sigenot would not believe the story. He thought
that Grim and Hilde had been murdered in their sleep by
Dietrich and his comrade for the sake of their hoard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Years passed on. One evening the heroes were seated together
in the great hall of the palace, drinking their wine and
talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Master,” said King Dietrich, “I never saw a living wife
embrace her husband so passionately as Hilde did you that
day in the cave. I think the Lady Ute would be angry if she
heard how the giantess hugged you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a monster she was,” answered Hildebrand with a
shudder, “and you freed me from her clutches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said the king, laughing, “it showed my generosity.
I returned you good for evil that time, for you know I might
have remembered how many thrashings and floggings you had
given me when a boy. Now, confess, was I not generous?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am quite willing to do so,” replied Hildebrand with a
smile, and then added gravely; “but do not pride yourself too
much on the past, for the giant Sigenot has long been watching
for us in the mountains, that he may fall upon us and
avenge his uncle Grim’s death. From what I hear, he is so
strong that no mortal man can withstand him, and even an
army would fall before him like corn under the sickle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey! what new story is this?” cried the king. “So Grim’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
avenger is lying in wait in the mountains? Why did no one
tell me before? I will start to-morrow in search of him, and
free my realm from the monster.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What!” cried one of the guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you going to attack the giant?” asked another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The murderous Sigenot!” added a third.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen to me, Dietrich, my pupil,” said Hildebrand solemnly,
“he is not heroic, but foolhardy, who undertakes to do the
impossible, and it is impossible to conquer that giant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen, dear master,” answered Dietrich; “do you remember
how you taught me that he is a hero who undertakes what is
apparently impossible, because he trusts in his strength, and in
the justice of his cause? He is a hero, whether he gains the
crown of victory or meets with death. My cause is just, because
I go forth to free my realm and my people from the
power of the monster.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire,” cried Hildebrand, “you are no longer my pupil, but
my comrade, and as your comrade I will accompany you to the
great battle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king answered after a short pause, “My master used to
say, ‘One against one is the way of true warriors; two against
one is the way of cowards’—so I must go alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you do not return in eight days,” returned the master, “I
will follow you, and be your liberator, or your avenger, or your
companion in death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why make so much ado?” cried Wolfhart; “the king will
strike old Long-legs dead, or else uncle Hildebrand will do it, and
if they both should fail, I will follow them, and I wager my head
that I will lead him like a captive bear by a rope to the castle
here, and then hang him over the battlements, where he may
stay till his gossips in hell come to fetch him home.”</p>

<img src='images/i_138.jpg' alt='DIETRICH CHASING THE ELK.' class='ig013' />
<p>DIETRICH CHASING THE ELK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich then set out on his journey. On the evening of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
third day he came in sight of the Mountains. He felt so cheery
and so strong that he would not have feared to offer battle to
all the giants in the world. As he was lying on the grass, sunk
in happy reverie, he saw a stately elk, sprang on his horse, and
followed it until he came up with it, when drawing his sword he
stabbed it in the neck, so that it fell dead. He lighted a fire,
roasted a bit of the elk for his supper, and ate it, washing it down
with some cups of wine he drew from the skin at his saddle bow.</p>

<p class='c007'>A cry of agony disturbed him in the midst of his enjoyment.
He looked up, and saw a naked giant covered from head to foot
with bristly hair, who was holding a dwarf firmly bound to the
end of his iron club. The mannikin shrieked to the warrior for
help, affirming that the monster was about to eat him alive.
Dietrich at once advanced towards the wild man, and offered him
a fair exchange. He said he might have the elk instead of the
dwarf, and that he would find it a larger and juicier mouthful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get out of the way, you dog,” bellowed the giant. “Get out
of the way, or I will roast you at your own fire, and eat you up,
armour and all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero’s anger was stirred at this address, and he drew
Nagelring from its sheath, while the giant swept the dwarf from
off his club as easily as a snowflake. Then the battle began,
and raged until both combatants were so weary that they had
to rest awhile. The king again offered to make peace with the
monster, because he had come out to fight with the master and
not with the servant. A shout of scornful laughter was the
answer he received, and then the giant cried in a mighty voice
that made the trees tremble to their roots, “Do you think that
a little smidget like you could conquer Sigenot? He would bind
you to a stake as easily as I should that dwarf, and would leave
you to die in agony.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And now the fray was renewed. The dwarf, who had freed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
himself from his bonds, kept well behind Dietrich, and advised
him what to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hit him over the ear with the hilt of your sword, the blade
is of no use with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich did as he was advised, and the monster fell with a
crash beneath his blow. The sword-hilt had penetrated deep into
his skull; a second and a third blow put an end to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now quick, let us away,” cried the dwarf, “before Sigenot,
king of the Mountains, comes down upon us. Should he find
us here, we are lost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Proud of his victory, Dietrich explained the object of his quest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Noble hero,” said the mannikin, “you cannot escape your fate.
If by a miracle you are victorious, we poor dwarfs will be freed
from an intolerable tyranny, in gratitude for which boon we will
be your faithful friends as long as you live. Our father, Alberich,
left the rule over thousands of our people in equal portions to me,
his eldest son, Waldung, and to Egerich, his younger son. But
in spite of our caps of darkness, and all our magic arts, Sigenot
has enslaved us, and holds us now in such vile bondage that many
die of hardships, and many more are devoured by him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Dietrich, “show your gratitude by pointing out
the way to Sigenot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwarf showed the hero the snow-topped mountain where
his enemy lived, drew the cap of darkness over his head, and
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich set out, and about mid-day arrived at the regions of
ice and snow. Long grey moss hung pendant from the branches
of the pines, and covered the stems to the root. A thick mist
suddenly rose, and hid the mountain. All at once the mist
parted like a curtain, and Dietrich saw a beautiful woman in
snow-white garments, a diadem of precious stones on her head,
and round her throat a necklace that shone like the stars. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
raised her finger warningly, and said, “Ride back, hero of Bern,
or you are lost. The destroyer is lying in ambush for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She glided past with inaudible steps, and vanished among the
glaciers, leaving Dietrich lost in astonishment, and wondering
whether it were the goddess Freya, or the elf-queen Virginal that
he had seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was startled out of his reverie by a shout, and at the same
moment perceived the gigantic warrior hastening to meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you have come at last,” he cried, “to give me an opportunity
of revenging the murder of Grim and Hilde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They began to fight without more ado. As Dietrich tried to
make use of what he thought a favourable chance, the blade of
his sword Nagelring was caught in an overhanging bough. All
his efforts to withdraw it were in vain. At last the steel broke,
and at the same moment a blow of the giant’s club stretched the
hero senseless on the ground. His helmet was unhurt, but the
blow had been so heavy that it left him unconscious. The giant
now fell upon him, kneaded his defenceless body both with his
hands and his knees, and then dragged him away into his
dismal den.</p>

<p class='c007'>Master Hildebrand waited for eight days with great impatience;
then, finding that the king did not return, he took leave of his
wife, and set forth in search of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the wood near the snow-capped mountain Hildebrand found
the king’s horse, and further on the broken sword. He could no
longer doubt what his friend’s fate had been. Vengeance, not
deliverance, was now alone what he hoped for, and he rode on
unheeding the warning that the little dwarf Waldung called after
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>On perceiving the new comer the giant rushed upon him. The
battle between them was long and fierce, and Sigenot disdained
no weapon of defence. He tore up bushes and even trees, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
threw them at the hero. When Hildebrand at last tried to defend
himself by a ruse, the club came down upon his head, and struck
him senseless to the ground. “Come on, long beard,” shouted
Sigenot, “Hilde and Grim are avenged at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, he bound the fallen warrior hand and foot, and
seizing him by the head, flung him over his shoulder, and bore
him to his cave, singing loudly the while.</p>

<p class='c007'>The giant’s dwelling was large and lofty. The roof was supported
by stone pillars, and a carbuncle in the centre shed a
pleasant light over the foreground, while the back of the cavern
was dark and gloomy in the extreme. On entering, the giant
threw down his burden with such force that Hildebrand thought
every bone in his body was broken. Sigenot then went to a side
cave to fetch an iron chain with which to bind his prisoner, saying
that he would not be long away.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a weak man is in sore straits, he at once gives himself
up for lost. Not so the hero. He never abandons hope until he
has tried every mode of rescue, however poor. It was thus with
Hildebrand. Looking round him, he perceived his good sword,
which the giant had seized as rightful booty, lying in a distant
corner, and he thought that he might yet fight and gain the
victory, if he could only cut the cords that bound his wrists. He
was fastened to a square pillar with sharp corners. He sawed
the cords on his wrists against the pillar, and cut them through.
No sooner were his hands free, than he undid the ropes and cords
about his feet, and snatching up his sword, hid behind the pillar,
which he intended to use as a protection, his shield having been
left in the wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sigenot returned with the chains, and looked about in astonishment.
His prisoner was gone. Suddenly he caught sight of him
behind a pillar, and the battle raged anew. The ground trembled
beneath the giant’s tread, and the rocks re-echoed the sound of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
blows. The combatants were now fighting in the dark background
of the cave, led there by the gradual retreat of Hildebrand, when
suddenly the hero heard his name called from the depths beyond.
He recognised the king’s voice, and the knowledge that his friend
yet lived gave added strength to his arm. A few minutes more,
and the giant was stretched at his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The victory was won. He cut off the monster’s head, and
whilst resting for a moment after his exertion, he heard Dietrich’s
voice exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hildebrand, dear master, help me out of the serpent’s hole.
There are still some adders here, alive, though I have slain and
eaten many more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Finding that the king was confined in a deep hole, Hildebrand
looked round for a rope or a ladder, with which to help
him out. Whilst engaged in this search, he was joined by the
dwarf Waldung, who gave him a ladder of ropes, by means of
which the king was restored to the light of day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hildebrand,” said Dietrich, taking a long breath of the fresh
pure air, “you are not my comrade, but my master.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After this, the heroes followed the dwarf into his subterranean
kingdom, where he provided them with food and drink, and
offered them costly treasures. The noblest gift that Dietrich
accepted was his sword Nagelring mended, hardened, and newly
adorned with gold and precious stones, so that it was more
beautiful as well as stronger than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes now returned to Bern, where they were received
with great joy.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Queen Virginal.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Once when Dietrich and Hildebrand were hunting in the wild
mountains of Tyrol, the king confessed that he had never been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
able to forget Queen Virginal, who had come out to warn him
of Sigenot’s approach.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would find it as easy to gain the love of a star as to
wile Queen Virginal away from her glaciers and snow mountains,”
said Hildebrand.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the heroes were thus talking together, a tiny little
mannikin dressed in full armour suddenly stood before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Noble warriors,” he said, “you must know that I am Bibung,
the unconquerable protector of Queen Virginal, ruler of all the
dwarfs and giants in these mountains. With my help she
chased thievish Elbegast away from her dominions; but the
wretch has now invaded her realm with the help of the
magician Ortgis, his giants and his lind-worms. He has forced
her by his black art to pay him a shameful tribute. He obliges
her every full moon to give him one of her beautiful maidens,
whom he then imprisons, fattens, and eats for his dinner. So
Jeraspunt, her palace, is filled with weeping and mourning. My
lady, hearing that you conquered the dread Sigenot, entreats you
to come to her aid; therefore hasten to Jeraspunt and rescue
our great queen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes consented, and asked to be shown the way. The
dwarf guided them till they came within sight of a wondrous
building shining on the heights in the light of the evening sun.
Hildebrand broke the silence that had fallen on them by exclaiming,
“Truly if the lady Ute were not my wife, I should be
inclined to try my luck with Queen Virginal; but as things
are, I will do my best to help you to win her. Well, Bibung!—why,
where in the world has the rascal got to?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The unconquerable protector of the queen has a wholesome
terror of Ortgis,” laughed Dietrich. “But now let us on to the
palace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Night is the time for witches to journey, not honest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
men,” said Hildebrand, “so let us stretch ourselves on the soft
moss, and rest until morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning was dull and misty, and a snow storm
beat in the faces of the warriors as they climbed the steep mountain
on foot, by a road impassable for horses. On and on they
went, a weary way. As they stopped to slake their thirst at
a spring, they heard a woman’s voice shrieking for help. A
girl rushed up to them and entreated their aid against terrible
Ortgis, to whom she had been delivered according to the treaty,
and who was now hunting her down with his dogs. At the same
moment the holloa of the huntsman was heard, and in another
the battle of the heroes with Ortgis and his followers had begun.
Gigantic as were Ortgis and his train, they soon fell under the
swords of the heroes. One man alone escaped, but he was the
worst of the whole crew, for he was Janibas, son of Ortgis, and
a great magician like his father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich and Hildebrand determined to take shelter in the
castle of Ortgis which was nigh at hand. When they knocked
at the door several armed giants rushed out upon them, but at
length they too were conquered. A horseman in black armour
had kept behind the rest during the battle. He murmured
something in a strange language, and obedient to his voice, new
giants arose out of the earth, to take the place of the slain;
still the heroes were victorious. The black horseman continued
to murmur, and horrible lind-worms crept out of the ground,
and with them Dietrich and Hildebrand had to fight all night
long. The black horseman disappeared at last, when the first
rays of the rising sun lighted up the castle in the valley. At
the same moment the heroes saw an enormous old lind-worm
crawling away with an armed man in its jaws. It wanted to
creep away unnoticed, but the warriors immediately attacked it.
The dragon let its victim fall, and hurled itself, hissing, upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
Dietrich who stood nearest. With one claw it tore away his
shield and ripped up his coat of mail; at the same time it
caught up Hildebrand with its tail and flung him to a great
distance. But Dietrich thrust his sword right through its jaws,
and so deep into a neighbouring tree, that the creature was
pinned down, and died a few minutes after, roaring like thunder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The maiden they had saved from Ortgis had watched the
combat from afar. She now approached and bound up Dietrich’s
wounds, pouring in a healing balm. Meanwhile, Hildebrand had
picked up the man the dragon had let fall, and recognised him
as Ruotwin, the son of Helfrich of Tuscany, who was his mother’s
brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ruotwin joined the other two, and promised to help them to
punish the wizard Janibas. Further help appeared in the person
of Helfrich. The whole party now moved on towards the
magician’s castle, the gates of which stood open. The court was
full of armed men, amongst whom was Janibas in black armour,
riding on a coal black steed. He murmured magic words, and
lions rushed out on the heroes. These great beasts were slain,
and so were the men-at-arms who followed them. Janibas alone
escaped.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich and his followers entered the castle, where they found
three of the queen’s maidens cooped up for fattening, and set
them free. After which, they burnt the magician’s fortress, that
it might not serve as a refuge to Janibas if he returned to that
part of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole party then started for Aron, the castle of Helfrich,
where the heroes were to rest before continuing their journey
to the palace of Queen Virginal. A short respite from their toil
was the more necessary, as Dietrich’s wounds were very painful;
but their hostess’s good nursing had soon the happiest effect in
subduing the fever, and healing the wounds. At last the day
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
was fixed for their departure, and Helfrich had settled to go
with them, and lead them to Jeraspunt. While they were making
their final arrangements, a dwarf galloped up to the door, and
throwing himself from his horse, entered the hall, his mantle
torn and dusty, and his countenance as pale as death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help, noble heroes, help!” he cried. “Janibas has come
against Queen Virginal in battle array. He has ordered her to
deliver all her maidens up to him, and also the carbuncle in
her coronet. If he gets that into his power, no one can withstand
him, for it would give him complete command over all
the mountains, and over all the giants, dwarfs and lind-worms
that inhabit them. Woe to them, if they fall into his hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich at once declared his readiness to go alone to the
queen’s help, if the others were not prepared to start on the
instant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, alone!” cried the dwarf. “If you go alone you are
a dead man. Even I, her majesty’s special defender, had to
turn my back, and fly before the foe; what then would become
of you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nobody could help laughing at the mannikin’s conceit; but
there was no time to lose, and all the warriors hastened to arm
and start for the palace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes and their friends had a long and hard pull up the
mountain side, over snow fields and glaciers, in the midst of
which great crevasses yawned in unexpected places, but they were
cheered on their way by catching from every height a glimpse
of Jeraspunt. At length they came so near that they heard
shrieks and howls, and other sounds of battle. A few minutes
later the terrible scene was visible. Some of the palace guard
were killed and mangled, others were yet defending themselves.
Gigantic dogs, monsters of every sort, and hordes of savage
warriors formed the enemy’s ranks. Many had forced their way
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
through the broken gate, and were raging, storming, and howling
round the queen’s throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sovereign lady sat there unmoved, surrounded by her
trembling maidens; a carbuncle glowed in the diadem that
graced her head, and a silver veil was wrapt about her. Her
only protection seemed to be a magic circle that her assailants
could not pass. Whether the magic lay in her wonderful beauty
or in the spiritual love that shone in her face, it were impossible
to say. No one had yet dared to approach her. Even the
heroes halted for a moment on first seeing her, but then recovering
themselves, pressed forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>They made their way in spite of clouds of snow, and lumps
of ice, to say nothing of a frightful hurricane that almost blew
them away. The mountains trembled under repeated thunder
claps, and a bottomless crevasse divided them from the palace.
But at the same moment Dietrich perceived the black horseman
reading his magic spells from an iron tablet. He sprang upon
him, broke the tablet, and slew the magician. A great clap of
thunder rolled over the mountains, avalanches fell, ice fields
broke up, and then came a silence as of death. The spell was
broken, the yawning gulf closed, and the way to the palace was
free. The magician’s followers, eager to avenge their master,
attacked the heroes and their men, but their efforts were vain.
The monsters, who yet lived, had soon to fly and seek refuge
in the solitudes of the snow mountains.</p>

<p>DIETRICH ESPIES QUEEN VIRGINAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich now approached the queen at the head of his followers.
He would have knelt before her, but she rose from
her throne, and offering him her hand, greeted him with a kiss.
Unable to utter a word, he let her lead him to the throne, and
seated himself at her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Know, great hero,” she said, “that I have seen your love
and your deeds. I give up my rule in Elf-land, and will go
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
home with you, and live amongst mortal men till death parts
us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The palace was cleansed by invisible hands; the gate, and all
the broken posts and pillars were mended during the night, and
the marriage of the mortal hero with the elf-queen was solemnized
soon after. The husband and wife then started for Bern, where
Virginal made his home so delightful that it was long before
Dietrich thought of seeking more adventures. Meanwhile there
was sorrow in the mountains, and in the heart of every elf that
lived there. The queen had left her country and her people
for the sake of a mortal. All nature mourned her absence, the
sunsets had no longer the prismatic hues of former times, and
the fairy palace was invisible to all.</p>

    DIETRICH’S COMRADES.</h3>

    <p class='center'><span class='sc'>Heime.</span></p>

<p class='dc6'>In all countries and amongst all
nations were spread the name
and fame of Dietrich of Bern,
for he was the favourite hero
of many a wandering minstrel, and so it came to pass that
numbers of brave warriors used to go and visit him, and take
part in the amusements or serious occupations that engrossed
the attention of their host during the time of their visit.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
Even in the far north his name was famous, not only in the
castle of the noble, but in many a wayside inn and solitary
grange.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of which we speak, a renowned horse-dealer called
Studas lived in the heart of a great forest. He cared little for
the singing and fiddling of the wandering minstrels, but his
son Heime was different. He often declared that he knew he
could wield lance and sword as well as the hero of Bern. His
father was weary of his vainglorious talk, and one day, when
the young fellow was boasting as usual that he was as good a
man as Dietrich, if not better, his father exclaimed in a pet:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if that be the case, go up to the hollow mountain, and
kill the dragon that is doing all this mischief in the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lad looked up at him inquiringly. The father nodded,
and Heime, casting a haughty look at him, turned and went
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will not do it,” muttered the old man, “but I think I
have cooled his hot blood for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Things were going otherwise than honest Studas dreamed in
his philosophy. His bold son armed himself, and mounting one
of his father’s best horses, rode off to the mountain. The lind-worm
sprang at him with open jaws, but the lad plunged his
spear into his mouth with such force that the point came out
behind his head. The monster lashed the ground long and
furiously with his tail, but at length fell dead. Whereupon
Heime cut off his head, and riding home, took it into the grange,
and flung the trophy at his father’s feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“St. Kilian!” cried Studas. “Boy, have you really killed the
dragon? Well——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” answered the bold youth, “I shall now go and slay
the hero of Bern. Give me the horse that carried me so bravely
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
to-day. He will take me to Bern, and bring me home again
without hurt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man felt his head go round when he heard his son
speak in such a way; but he granted the lad’s request, and
Heime rode out into the unknown world.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the royal palace of Bern Queen Virginal was busy filling
the goblets of the warriors, who feasted with her husband, and
who agreed that great as were the blessings of peace, it was high
time they should be up and doing something, lest their swords
should rust in their scabbards. In the midst of this conversation
the door opened, and a stranger entered in full armour. He was
a tall broad-shouldered man, and apparently young.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hildebrand welcomed him, and invited him to take off his
coat-of-mail, telling him that purple and silken garments were
more suited to a royal feast than the panoply of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My trade is war,” said the stranger, “I am Heime, son of the
horse-dealer Studas, and have come to challenge the famous
Dietrich to come out with me into the open field, and try which
of us is the better man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke so loud that every one heard, and Dietrich at once
accepted his challenge, calling upon his guests to come out and
watch the fray. The king then put on his armour, mounted his
good horse, Falcon, and in another moment was ready for the
combat.</p>

<p class='c007'>They fought for some time on horseback, but at length the
shafts of their spears being broken in the mêlée, they sprang to
the ground, and continued the combat on foot. Again a little
time, and after Heime had performed wonderful feats of valour,
his sword broke, and he stood defenceless before the angry king.
Dietrich swung his sword above his head preparatory to giving
his opponent the death-blow, but he had not the heart to do it.
He had compassion on the youth and courage of the bold warrior,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
who stood so fearless before him. Letting his sword fall to his
side, the king offered his hand to Heime in sign of peace. This
generosity conquered the lad completely. He took the offered
hand, said that he confessed himself overcome, and swore that
henceforth he would be a faithful servant and follower of the
glorious king. Dietrich was pleased to number a man like
Heime among his followers, and presented him with castles and
rich lands.</p>

<p>EIGEL SHOOTS THE APPLE OFF HIS SON’S HEAD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Wittich.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Wittich was the son of Wieland, the smith of Heligoland, by
Böswilde (Badhilda). From his earliest childhood his father had
taught him the use of the bow, and the greatest praise he ever
gave him was to say,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a bowman like my brother Eigel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Wittich wanted very much to learn all that he could
about his uncle, and Wieland began:</p>

<p class='c007'>“When your mother’s father—Niduder, Drost of the Niars—made
me a prisoner long ago, my brother Eigel came to his
castle, and entered his service as bowman of the guard. Every
one admired his skill. He could shoot away the head of an
eagle that was flying high as the heavens. I have also seen him
aim an arrow at the right or left foot of a lynx, and pin it
to the bough on which the creature sat. And he did other
wonderful things too numerous to relate. But the Drost wanted
to see something more wonderful still, so he desired him to
shoot an apple off the head of his own child at a hundred paces
off, telling him at the same time that if he refused, or if obeying,
he missed his mark, he would have the boy hewn in pieces before
his eyes. Eigel drew three arrows from his quiver, and fitted one
to the bowstring. The boy stood motionless, looking at his father
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
with perfect confidence. Could you have done that, my lad?
Eh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No father,” answered Wittich boldly, “I would have fetched
your trusty sword Mimung, and have hewn off the head of
that wicked old man; and then, if his Niars had tried to
avenge him, I would have chased them out of the country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All very fine, young hero,” laughed the father, “but remember
this; a true hero only speaks of what he <em>has</em> done,
not of what he <em>would</em> have done under such and such circumstances.
It would have been better, however, if Eigel had done
something of that kind. After he had shot away the apple,
he turned to the Drost, and told him, that had he by any
accident killed his son, he would have used the two other
arrows in shooting him first, and then himself. The Drost
took no notice of the speech at the time, but soon afterwards,
he exiled the bowman without thanks or payment, and no one
knows what has become of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The smith brought up his son on tales like this, which
naturally excited the boy’s ardour for adventure, and made him
more and more unwilling to work at the forge. One day the
lad spoke out, and asked his father to give him a suit of
armour, and the good sword Mimung, that he might hie away
to Bern, fight with king Dietrich, and win a kingdom like
his ancestors. After many refusals the smith at last gave his
consent, and furnished his son with all that he needed for the
enterprise, explaining to him the special virtues of each weapon.
Finally he told him to remember that his great-grandfather,
King Wilkinus, a mighty warrior in his day, had married a
mermaid, who, when the king was dying, had promised him, by
the memory of their love, that she would help any of their
descendants who asked for her aid. “Go down to the sea-shore,
my son,” continued the smith, “if ever you are in need,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
and demand the protection of our ancestress.” And then with
much sage advice, together with many old stories of things he
had seen and known, Wieland took leave of his son.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wittich rode on for many days before he met with any
adventure. At length he came to a broad river, and dismounting,
took off his armour, which he laid upon the bank,
and began to wade across the water, leading his horse Skemming
by the bridle. When half way across, three horsemen in full
armour passed by, and seeing him began to taunt him and
ask him where he was going. He told them that if they
would wait until he had put his armour on, he was ready to
try conclusions with them. They agreed, but no sooner did
they see him dressed in his coat of mail, and mounted on his
good steed, than they bethought them, that as they were in a
strange place, it would be better to have a man of such thews
and sinews for a comrade than an enemy. So they offered
him peace instead of war. He accepted, and after shaking
hands, they journeyed on together.</p>

<p class='c007'>They rode up stream for a long way, and at last they came
to a castle. A host of savage-looking men poured out of the
gates, and advanced to meet them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are too many for us to conquer,” said the eldest of
the strangers, “still I think that our good swords may enable
us to hew our way across the bridge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me go and offer them a silver piece as toll,” said
Wittich, and setting spurs to his horse he rode on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at the bridge, he was informed that the only toll
demanded or accepted there were the horse, armour, clothes,
right hand and right foot of the traveller. He explained that
he could not afford to pay so high a price for so small a benefit,
and offered them a piece of money. Whereupon they drew
their swords and attacked him.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
The three warriors meanwhile kept on a neighbouring height,
and watched and commented on all that went on below. Seeing
that their new friend seemed hard beset, two of them galloped
to his assistance, while the third held back in scorn. But
before they reached the place of combat, seven of the robbers
were slain, and at sight of them the others took flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes now rode on to the castle, where they found plenty
of food and much booty. While they enjoyed their evening
meal, their tongues were unloosed, and each told his name and
deeds. Wittich had more to tell about his father than about
himself, and then he learnt that the eldest of his new companions
was Master Hildebrand, the second strong Heime, and
the third Yarl Hornboge, who was also a comrade of Dietrich.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a stroke of good luck for me,” cried the young
warrior, “for I am on my way to Bern to try my strength
against the glorious king, and I have good hope that I may
win the day, for my father has given me his sword Mimung
that can cut through steel and stone. Just look at the hilt,
is not the workmanship beautiful?”</p>

<p class='c007'>On hearing this, the three comrades grew more silent, and
proposed to go to rest, as they were very tired. Wittich
followed their example.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young hero was soon snoring in company with Heime
and Hornboge, but Hildebrand lay awake, a prey to sad forebodings.
He knew that Wittich’s sword could cut through his
master’s helmet, and he considered what was to be done. He
crept noiselessly from his bed, and taking Mimung, compared it
with his own sword. The two blades were wonderfully alike,
but not the hilts. So with a grim smile of satisfaction, he
carefully unscrewed the blades from the hilts, and exchanged
them; then returned to his couch, and soon after fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>They started again on their journey next morning. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
course of a few days, they met with several adventures that
proved to Hildebrand and his comrades that Wittich was of
the stuff that heroes are made of.</p>

<p class='c007'>On hearing of the arrival of his old master and the rest,
King Dietrich hastened out into the court to meet and welcome
them. But his astonishment was great when the young stranger
pulled off his silver gauntlet and handed it to him. In another
moment Dietrich had snatched it, and flung it in the youth’s
face, exclaiming wrathfully:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think it is part of a king’s duty to make a target
of himself for every wandering adventurer to strike at? Here,
my men, seize the rascal, and hang him to the highest gallows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The power to do so is on your side,” answered Wittich,
“but bethink you, my lord, whether such a deed would not
bring dishonour on your fair fame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Hildebrand said, “Sire, this is Wittich, son of Wieland,
the celebrated smith. He is no mean man, or secret traitor,
but well worthy of a place in the ranks of your comrades.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, master,” replied the king, “I will fight him as
he desires, but should he be conquered, I will deliver him to
the hangman. It is my last word. Now come to the race-course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole town assembled to witness the duel between the
king and the stranger. The combat raged long, but at last
Wittich’s sword broke, and he stood defenceless before the
king.</p>

<p class='c007'>“False father, you deceived me,” he cried, “you gave me the
wrong sword, and not Mimung.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surrender, vagrant,” cried Dietrich, “and then to the gallows
with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young warrior’s last hour had come, if Hildebrand had
not sprung between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
“Sire,” he said, “spare an unarmed man, and make him
one of your comrades. We could not have a more heroic soul
in our company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. He shall go to the gallows. Stand back, master, that
he may once more lick the dust before me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The master was sick at heart. He thought of how he had
wronged the young hero by changing his sword: “Here, brave
warrior, is your sword Mimung,” he said, handing Wittich the
weapon at his side, “and now, Dietrich, do your best!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle began again, and Mimung showed its mettle now.
Bits of the king’s shield and armour fell away, and a home-stroke
laid his helmet open. “Surrender, king!” cried the
victorious youth; but Dietrich fought on, in spite of terrible
wounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the master sprang forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wittich,” he cried, “hold your hand, for it is not your
own strength, but Wieland’s sword that gives you victory. Be
our comrade, and then we shall rule the world, for, next to
the king, you are the bravest of all the heroes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Master,” replied Wittich, “you helped me in my need and
I will not now deny you.” Then turning to the king:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Glorious hero of Bern, I am your man henceforward, and
will be faithful to you as long as I live.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king took his offered hand in his firm grasp, and made
him ruler over a large fief.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Wildeber, Ilsan and other Comrades.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Ecke was the eldest son of the once powerful king Mentiger
by the mermaid whom he made his queen. He loved Queen
Seeburg, who lived at Cologne in the Rhineland. Seeburg
had a great desire to see King Dietrich, and Ecke on hearing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
of it, promised to bring him to her, or die in the attempt.
She, on her side, said that she would be his wife if he came
home successful. He went, met Dietrich, and after showing
prodigies of valour, died at his hands, much to the sorrow of
the king, who had learnt to love him during the few hours of
their acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Dietrich returned to Bern after slaying Ecke, Heime
came out to meet him, and was so outspoken in his joy at
seeing him again, that the king, much touched, gave him his
good sword Nagelring as a sign of his friendship. The warrior
received it with delight, and kissed the trusty blade twice or
thrice, as he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will wear this sword for the glory of my king, and will
never part with it as long as I live.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are unworthy of the sword,” cried Wittich, who had
come up with the other warriors: “Do you remember how you
left your weapon in its sheath when the robbers were attacking
me, and that Hildebrand and Hornboge alone helped me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your self-sufficiency had made me angry, as your spiteful
tongue does now. I will cut it out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both men put their hands to their swords, but the king
stepped between them, and desired them to keep the peace in
the castle. When he learnt all that had happened, Dietrich told
Heime that he might go his way, because it was not seemly in
a warrior to leave his comrade unaided in danger. But he
added, that when he had shown by brave deeds that he was
really a hero, he might return to them once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, sire, I think I shall win myself greater wealth by
Nagelring than I lose in the castles you now take from me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus spoken, the bold warrior sprang on his horse, and
rode away without taking leave of any one. He rode on, till
he reached the Wisara (Weser), where he drew a band of robbers
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
around him, and wrought great mischief. He plundered the
defenceless country-people, and even bold warriors had to pay
him black mail; and thus, through highway robbery, he became
the owner of a great hoard of wealth, which he was never tired
of increasing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich had to tell his friends of his terrible combat with the
hero Ecke, in which he had won the beautiful suit of armour he
brought home with him, and the good sword Ecke-sax. One
day, when the warriors were discussing this subject, a monk entered
the hall, and remained standing humbly near the door. He
was tall and broad-shouldered, and his cowl was pulled forward
so as to hide his face. The servants began to play him tricks,
until at last the monk, growing impatient, seized one of his
persecutors by the ear, and held him up shrieking in the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the king asked the reason of the noise, the monk stepped
forward, and begged a morsel of bread for a half-starved penitent.
Dietrich came forward himself, and commanded food and drink
to be placed before the brother; but his astonishment was great
when the monk pushed back his cowl, and displayed well rounded
cheeks that bore no trace of starvation. He was still more
surprised when he saw the quantity of food and wine the reverend
brother could dispose of.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The holy man has the appetite of a wolf,” murmured the
bystanders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Five long years have I done penance by prayer, fasting
and water-drinking,” he said, “and have now license from the
venerable prior to go out into the world, and lay penance on other
sinners. Now,” he continued, going on with his meal, “ye be all
miserable sinners with your continual feasting and drinking, and I
call upon you to do penance, and be converted, that your sins
be blotted out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he intoned, in a loud ringing voice, “O Sanctissima.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
Master Hildebrand had joined the group, and now exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, it is my own dear brother, Ilsan the Monk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Culpa mea,” cried the monk; “touch me not, unholy brother.
Confess, and do penance, that thou go not straight to hell like
the others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” said the master, “we are all collected here together to
convert, by kindness or force, all monsters, giants, and dwarfs; so,
my reverend brother, I now beg of you to lay aside your robes,
and once more become one of us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Convert, say you? Yea, I have license to convert the heathen,
and will therefore join you in your pious work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words, the monk flung off his robes, and stood
before them dressed in full armour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here,” he cried, touching his broadsword, “is my preacher’s
staff, and here,” pointing to his coat of mail, “my breviary. St.
Kilian pray for me and for all of us, Ora pro nobis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He sat down amongst the warriors, who had all known the
stout monk Ilsan for many years. He drank and sang, now
psalms, now songs, and told merry tales of his life in the
monastery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evening came on apace. Candles and torches were lighted.
Suddenly every one was startled by a strange creature pattering
in at the door. It was like a bear to look upon. Its head
resembled that of a boar, but its hands and feet were of human
form. The monster stood as though rooted to the threshold, and
appeared to be considering on whom first to make its spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An evil spirit,” cried Ilsan; “a soul escaped from the purgatorial
fire. I will address it. Conjuro te ...” He paused,
for the monster had turned its face to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will drag him back to his purgatory again,” cried bold
Wolfhart, springing over the table, and seizing the creature by
its fur. But pull and tug as he might, he could not move it by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
so much as an inch. It quietly gave the warrior such a kick,
that he fell head over heels into the middle of the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hornboge, Wittich, and other warriors tried to push the monster
out with their united strength, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give room, brave comrades,” cried the angry king. “I will
see whether the monster is proof against my sword Ecke-sax.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire,” interrupted Master Hildebrand, catching him by the
arm, “look; do you not see a golden bracelet, sparkling with
precious stones, on the creature’s wrist? It is a man—perhaps a
brave warrior.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said the king, turning to his strange guest, “if you are
indeed a hero, doff your disguise. Join us, and be our faithful
comrade.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On hearing these words, the strange guest threw off boar’s
head and bear’s skin, and stood before the king and his followers
clad in armour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know you now,” said Hildebrand. “You are the brave hero
Wildeber, surnamed The Strong. And the gold bracelet is the
gift of a swan-maiden, and makes your strength double. But
why did you so disguise yourself? Every brave man is a welcome
guest to our king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wildeber seated himself by the master’s side, emptied a goblet
of sparkling wine, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Once, after fighting a hard fight with robbers, I lay down to
sleep on the bank of a lake. Suddenly I was awakened by a
splashing in the water. Turning my eyes in the direction of the
noise, I saw a beautiful maiden bathing. I spied her swan-garment
lying on the bank, crept up to it softly, took it, and
hid it. The maiden sought it everywhere, and when she could
not find it, she began to weep aloud. I went to her, and begged
that she would follow me home and be my wife. But she wept
the more, and said that she must die if she were deprived of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
bird’s dress. I was sorry for her, and gave it back, whereupon
she gave me this bracelet, which increases my strength immensely;
but she told me that to preserve it I must wander about as
a bear with a boar’s head, until the most famous king on earth
chose me to be one of his comrades. If I did not obey her, she
warned me that the virtue of the jewel would depart, and I should
soon be slain in battle. Having thus spoken, she flew away.
That is why I came to you in such disguise, brave hero,” he
continued, addressing Dietrich; “and as you have received me
into the ranks of your comrades of your own free will, I hope
that the bracelet will retain its magic power as long as I live.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pax vobiscum!” stammered the monk, as he staggered away
to bed. The other warriors soon followed his example, and
silence reigned in the palace.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Dietleib.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>King Dietrich was one day about to mount his horse, and set
out to visit his brother monarch, the Emperor Ermenrich, when
a warrior rode into the court. The king at once knew him to be
Heime. He was not much pleased to see him back at Bern, but
when Heime told him that he had been victorious in many battles
against giants and robbers, he consented to receive him once
more into the ranks of his comrades, and desired him to accompany
him and certain of his followers to Romaburg.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Fritilaburg, where they rested, Dietrich accepted the offered
service of a man who called himself Ilmenrik, son of a Danish
yeoman Soti; and enrolled him amongst his servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they came to Romaburg, they were received with all
honour by the emperor, who gave them both board and lodging.
But the emperor forgot one thing in his plans, and that was, to
provide food for the servants. Ilmenrik fed them the first night.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
On the second, his private resources being exhausted, he pawned
Heime’s armour and horse for ten gold pieces; on the third, he
pawned Wittich’s goods for twenty; and on the fourth, he got
thirty for the weapons and horse of the king. On the fifth day,
when the king gave orders for their return home, Ilmenrik asked
for money to free the articles he had pawned. Dietrich was
astonished and angry when he heard how extravagant his servant’s
ideas had been. He took him before Ermenrich, who at once
said he would pay the sum required, and asked how much it was.
The emperor and all his court made merry at Ilmenrik’s expense,
especially Walter of Wasgenstein (Vosges), who asked him if he
was a were-wolf, and well up in strange knowledge of all kinds.
Ilmenrik modestly answered that he had learnt to perform many
feats of strength and skill from his father, such as putting the
stone and throwing the hammer; and that he would wager his
head against the lord of Wasgenstein’s that he could beat him
in this. Walter accepted his challenge, and the trial began.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such skill as Ilmenrik displayed had never been seen before.
The heroes all feared for the life of the brave warrior of Wasgenstein.
The emperor then called the young victor to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hearken to me, young sir,” he said; “I will buy the head
of my vassal from you at whatever price you list. Gold for
blood is the old law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fear not, sire,” answered Ilmenrik, “the head of the brave
hero is in no danger from me. I do not want it. But if you
wish to do me a kindness, lend me so much money as I have
expended for the keep of the servants, that I may redeem the
weapons, garments, and horses that I pawned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Treasurer,” said the emperor, turning to one of his ministers,
“weigh out sixty marks of red gold, that the fellow may
redeem his pledges, and another sixty marks to fill his purse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, my lord,” returned the young man, “I do not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
need your gift, for I am a servant of the rich king of Bern,
who will see that I lack nothing; but if you will keep us
another day here, I will, with this sixty marks, treat the servants
to a better feast than before, and also my master, all
his warriors, and you yourself, should you desire to join the
party, even if I have to pawn horses and coats of mail again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The warriors all laughed at the merry youth, but Heime
frowned, and said that if ever he pawned his horse again it
should cost him his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The feast which the servant prepared them was of royal
magnificence. All were pleased except Heime, who secretly
feared that his property was again in pawn. The young fellow
seated himself at his side, and asked him in a low voice if he
knew who had given him that scar on his forehead. Heime
answered that it was Dietleib, son of Yarl Biterolf, adding that
he would know him again in a moment, and that the scar
should be avenged in blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ilmenrik replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Methinks, bold warrior, your memory has gone a-wool-gathering.
If you look me in the face, you will see that I am
that Dietleib whom you and your robbers attacked as he was
riding through a forest with his father. We slew the robber
Ingram and his companions, but you escaped with that wound,
thanks to the speed of your good horse. If you don’t believe
me, I have a witness here that will prove my words in the
open field. But if you will trust me, the matter may remain
a secret between us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the end of the feast, Dietrich told the youth that
he should no longer be a servant, but should be received into
the ranks of his comrades; and he, thanking him, answered that
he was really Dietleib, son of Yarl Biterolf, whose glorious deeds
were known far and wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
All the king’s followers, except Heime, received the young
hero into their ranks with pleasure. He returned to Bern
with the king, and proved himself his trusty comrade in many
an adventure. But he was of a restless mind, and wished to
see more of the world; so after a time he took service under
Etzel, king of the Huns, at whose court he found his father
settled. Father and son together were the doers of many a
daring deed. King Etzel, wishing to keep them in his service,
offered them the land of Steiermark (Styria) as a fief. Biterolf
gave up his share to his son, who was therefore surnamed the
Styrian, but who often appears in story by his right name of
Dietleib the Dane.</p>

    <h3 id='p1c3s3' class='mt'>III.<br />
    ADVENTURES. LAURIN. ILSAN</h3>

    <p class='center'><span class='sc'>King Laurin and The Little Rose-Garden.</span></p>

<p class='dc7'>Dietleib once came unexpectedly
on a visit to Master
Hildebrand at his castle of
Garden. He looked sadder than of old, and returned the
master’s greeting without an answering smile. Hildebrand
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
inquired the cause of his sadness, and he replied that he had a
sweet and wise sister named Künhild, who had kept house for
him in Styria. One day, when she was dancing with other
maidens in a green meadow, and he looking on, she suddenly
vanished from the circle, and no one knew what had become
of her.</p>
<p class='c007'>“Since then,” he continued, “I have learnt from a magician
that it was the dwarf king Laurin that hid her under a cap
of darkness, and carried her off to his hollow mountain. This
mountain is in Tyrol, where the dwarf has also a wonderful
Rose-garden. Now, good master, I have come to you for advice.
How can I free my sister from the power of the goblin?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a ticklish matter,” said Hildebrand, “and may cost
many a good life. I will go with you to Bern, to see Dietrich
and our other comrades, and then we can agree in council
what is the best plan to pursue. For the dwarf is powerful,
not only because of the extent of his empire, but from his
knowledge of magic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the heroes heard what had brought Hildebrand and
Dietleib to Bern, Wolfhart spoke first, and said that he would
adventure himself alone upon the quest, fetch home the maiden
safe and sound, and bring the royal mannikin to Bern bound
to his saddle-bow. Dietleib then asked Hildebrand if he knew
the way to the Rose-garden. He replied that he did, but that
Laurin watched over the garden himself, and exacted the left
foot and right hand of any one who was bold enough to venture
within its bounds, and spoil the roses.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He cannot exact this tribute,” said Wittich, “unless he gets
the better of the warrior in fair fight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well then,” added the king, “we will not touch the lovely
flowers. All we want is to save our friend’s sister from the
hands of the dwarf, and that is a labour beseeming a warrior.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
The heroes all swore to do no hurt to the garden, and then
Hildebrand consented to be their guide. The adventurers were
Hildebrand, Dietrich, Dietleib, Wittich, and Wolfhart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their road led them northward among the wild mountains,
and over crevasses, ice, and snow. It was a perilous way they
trod, but they recked nothing of fatigue or danger, for their
hearts beat high with hope. At length they reached the
garden: a lovely place, where spring reigned eternally, making
it a flowery oasis in a wintry desert. The heroes feasted
their eyes on the beautiful sight, and felt as though they had
reached the gates of paradise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfhart was the first to break the spell: setting spurs to
his horse, he called to his comrades to follow, and galloped
towards the garden. His mad career was soon checked by an
iron door with golden letters inscribed on it. He tried to
break open the door, but in vain; his comrades came to his
aid, and the door was at last beaten in by the four strong men.
The garden was still defended by a golden thread, such as used
to surround the palaces of the Ases in the olden time. The
warriors trod down the thread, and then, in spite of Hildebrand’s
warnings, began to pluck the roses and trample the garden.
Dietrich did not join in the work of destruction, but stood
apart under a linden tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly Hildebrand called out, “Draw your swords! Here
comes the master of the garden.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They all looked up, and saw something bright advancing
rapidly towards them. Soon they were able to distinguish the
form of a horseman riding a steed that was swift as the wind.
He was small of stature, and habited in a complete suit of
armour. His helmet was of specially beautiful workmanship,
and was further adorned with a diadem of jewels, in the midst
of which a carbuncle blazed like a sun. On beholding the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
damage that had just been done, he drew rein, and exclaimed
angrily:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What harm have I ever done you, robbers as you are, that
you should thus destroy my roses? If you had aught against
me, why did you not send me a challenge like honourable
men? You must now expiate your crime by each giving me
his right hand and left foot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you are King Laurin,” answered Dietrich, “we do indeed
owe you reparation, and will pay you a fine in gold; but we
cannot afford to lose our right hands, for we require them to
wield our swords; and as to our left feet, we could not well
ride were we deprived of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He would be a coward who talked of paying any fine except
in blows,” cried Wolfhart; “and I am determined to dash that
hop-o’-my-thumb, together with the cat he is riding, against the
cliffs over yonder, and then his bones will break into such tiny
pieces that even his grasshopper subjects can never collect them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this Laurin answered in words of defiance, and the
combat with Wolfhart began, only to end in the latter’s overthrow
the moment he felt the touch of the dwarf’s spear. Wittich was
not more fortunate than his friend, for he also was thrown from
his saddle at the first encounter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Laurin sprang from his horse, drew out a large knife, and
approached the hero, who lay senseless on the ground. Dietrich
sprang forward to rescue his comrade.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not venture the spear thrust, but close with him,” said
Hildebrand in a low voice. “Laurin has three magic charms of
which you must deprive him; and these are, a ring with the
stone of victory on his finger, a belt that gives him the strength
of twelve men round his waist, and in his pocket a cap of
darkness, which makes him invisible when he puts it on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a long and fierce wrestle, Dietrich managed to get
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
possession of the ring, which he at once gave into the master’s
charge. Again the combat raged, neither side gaining any
advantage. At last Dietrich begged for a short truce, which
Laurin granted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The truce over, the two kings renewed the fight. Dietrich
caught Laurin by the belt, and at the same moment the latter
clasped him round the knees so tight that he fell backwards.
The violence of his fall broke the belt he was holding, and it
slipped from his hand. Hildebrand then rushed forward and
caught it before the dwarf could pick it up. No sooner was
this done than Laurin went out of sight. Dietrich still felt the
blows he gave, but could not see him. Filled with a berserkir
rage at his own powerlessness, he forgot the pain of his wounds;
he flung away both sword and spear, sprang like a tiger in the
direction in which he heard the whistling of the invisible sword,
and seized his adversary for the third time. He tore away the
cap of darkness, and Laurin stood before him praying for peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall first cut off your right hand and left foot, and then
your head, and after that you may have peace,” cried the angered
hero, setting off in pursuit of the dwarf, who now took to his heels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Save me, Dietleib, my dear brother-in-law,” cried Laurin,
running up to that warrior; “your sister is my queen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietleib swung the little creature on horseback before him, and
galloped away into the wood. There he set him down, and told
him to hide himself until the king’s anger was abated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coming back to the place of combat, the warrior found Dietrich
on horseback, and as furious as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must have either the dwarf’s head or yours,” cried Dietrich.</p>

<p class='c007'>In another moment their swords were flashing; a second fight
would have begun had not Hildebrand held back the king by
main force, while Wittich did the same to Dietleib. After a little
they succeeded in making peace between the angry men, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
also in gaining grace for the dwarfs. Later still the warriors
might have been seen in friendly converse with each other and
with Laurin, who was then and there admitted as one of Dietrich’s
comrades.</p>

<p class='c007'>This point settled, the dwarf proposed to show them the wonders
of his hollow mountain, saying that Dietleib should then give his
sister to him as wife, with the usual ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the old law,” answered the hero of Steierland, “that when
a maiden has been carried away from her home and is recovered
by her friends, she should have free choice given her either to
remain with her husband, or return to her people. Are you
willing that it should be so in this case?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By all means,” said the dwarf. “Now let us go. Do you see
that snow-capped mountain? My palace is there—so to horse,
that my eyes may no longer be pained by seeing the wreck you
have wrought in my garden. The roses will bloom again in May.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The journey to the snow-capped mountain was much longer
than the warriors had imagined. It lasted till noon of the following
day. Below the snow, they came to a meadow that was
as beautiful as the rose-garden. The air was filled with the
perfume of flowers. Birds were singing in the branches, and little
dwarfs were to be seen hurrying to and fro. They followed Laurin
into the dark entrance of his underground kingdom. The only
one of their number who felt the least distrust was Wittich, who
had not forgotten the thrust of the dwarf king’s spear.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>In King Laurin’s Realm.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>A soft twilight reigned in the vast hall of the palace to which
they now came. The walls were of polished marble, inlaid with
gold and silver. The floor was formed of a single agate, the
ceiling of a sapphire, and from it there hung shining carbuncles
like stars in the blue sky of night. All at once it became light
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
as day. The queen came in surrounded by her maidens. Her
girdle and necklace were jewelled, and in her coronet was a
diamond that shone like the sun, bringing the brightness of day
wherever it came. But the lady herself was more beautiful than
aught else. None could take their eyes off her face. She seated
herself beside Laurin, and signed to her brother Dietleib to sit
down at the other side of her. She embraced him and asked him
many questions about her old home and friends. By this time
supper was ready. Laurin was a perfect host, and his guests were
soon quite at their ease. Even Wittich forgot to be suspicious.
When the meal was over, the dwarf king left the hall, and Dietleib
seized the opportunity to ask his sister whether she was willing
to remain in that underground paradise as its queen. She answered
with tears that she could not forget her home and friends;
that she would rather be a peasant girl in the upper world than
a queen among the dwarfs, and that though she must admit that
Laurin was very good and kind, yet he was not as other men.
Dietleib then promised to save her, or lose his life in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Laurin now returned, and asked the hero if he would like to
retire to his bedchamber. He took him there, and remained
talking with him for some time. At last he told him that his
comrades were all condemned to death, and that he had only
spared him because he was his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Traitor, false dwarf!” cried Dietleib. “I live and die with
my comrades, but you are in my power!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He started forward, but the dwarf was gone, and the door was
shut and locked on the outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Laurin then returned to the hall, filled the goblets of the
warriors from a particular jar, and entreated them to drink the
wine, which would insure them a good night’s rest. They did
so, and immediately their heads sank upon their breasts, and a
heavy drugged sleep fell upon them. Then turning to the queen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
Laurin desired her to go to her room, for these men must die in
punishment for the wreck they had made of his rose-garden;
adding that her brother was safely locked up in a distant room,
that he might escape the fate of his comrades. Künhild wept
aloud, and said that she would die if he carried out his cruel
purpose. He gave her no distinct answer, but reiterated his
command.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the queen had retired, he sounded his horn, and
immediately five giants and a number of dwarfs hurried into the
room. He commanded them to bind the warriors so tight with
cords that they could not move when they awoke. After that he
had them dragged to a dungeon, where they might remain until
he should decide their fate next morning. Having seen his orders
carried out, he went to bed, and began to think whether it would
be better to let the men off to please the queen, or to punish them
for their evil deed. The last seemed to him the wiser plan, and
he fell asleep, gloating over the intended slaughter of his helpless
victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich awoke soon after midnight; he felt that he was bound
hand and foot, and called to his comrades for aid; but they were
as powerless as he. Then Dietrich’s wrath was roused to such a
pitch, that his fiery breath burnt the cords that bound one hand,
and left it free. After that, it was a matter of little difficulty to
untie the knots at his wrist and feet, and then to set his comrades
at liberty. What was to be done now? They could not break
open their dungeon door. They had neither weapon nor coat of
mail. They were helpless victims. At this very moment, while
they were looking at each other in despair, they were startled by
hearing a woman’s voice asking in a low whisper if they were yet
alive.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We thank you, noble queen,” answered Hildebrand, “we are
alive and well, but totally unarmed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
So Künhild opened the door, and appeared on the threshold
with her brother. She placed her finger on her lips to enforce
silence, and led the way to where the heroes’ armour was piled.
As soon as they were ready, the queen gave each of them a ring,
by means of which he could see the dwarfs, even when they wore
their caps of darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurrah!” cried Wolfhart. “We can make as much noise as
we like, now that we have our armour on, and our weapons in
our hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Laurin, wakened by Wolfhart’s loud tones, knew that the prisoners
were free, and at once summoned his dwarfish army to his
assistance. The battle began, and raged for a long time without
any advantage being gained by either side. Laurin was pleased
in his heart of hearts that matters had turned out as they had, for
he was a bold little fellow, and liked open war better than trickery.
At length the underground forces were routed with great loss, and
Laurin himself was taken prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich spared the life of the dwarf king at fair Künhild’s
request, but deposed him from royal power, and gave the mountain
to Sintram, another dwarf of high rank, for a yearly tribute. When
everything was ordered to their liking, the heroes returned to Bern,
taking Laurin with them as a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was great joy in Bern at the return of the heroes, who
were much praised for their valiant deeds, while the unfortunate
Laurin was laughed at by all. There was only one person who
showed him any sympathy, and that was Künhild. One day she
met him when he was wandering about alone and melancholy.
She spoke to him kindly, tried to comfort him, and told him
he would soon gain the king’s friendship if he proved himself
to be faithful and true.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah,” he laughed bitterly; “they think that they have kicked
a dog who will lick their hands; but a trodden snake bites! You
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
may know what I intend to do. I have sent to inform Walberan,
my uncle, who rules over the dwarfs and giants from the Caucasus
to Sinai, of what has happened, and he is coming at the head of
his forces to be my avenger. He cannot fail to win the day, slay
strong Dietrich and his comrades, and lay the whole land waste.
When that is done, I will take you back to my kingdom, and
replant my Rose Garden, that it may be lovelier in May than
it ever was before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Laurin,” she answered, “you carried me away from home by
trickery and magic spells; but I have not been blind to your love,
and feel myself honoured by its greatness. I cannot live in your
underground kingdom, but I will love you and be your queen in
the Rose Garden, if you will think of love and faithfulness, and not
of revenge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She left him, and he sat pondering the matter for a long time.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days afterwards, Dietrich came to the Dwarf King, and,
taking him by the hand, said, that he had been his prisoner long
enough, that he must now sit with his comrades, or return to his
own home, whichever he liked best.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then,” continued the king, “I will go with you to your
Rose Garden next spring, and see it in its beauty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwarf silently followed the king into the hall. He sat at
Dietrich’s side at the feast, and thought over the vengeance he
would take when his uncle came.</p>

<p class='c007'>But lovely Künhild appeared and filled his goblet, saying a few
kind words the while, and immediately love conquered hatred, and
he cried, emptying the goblet to the last drop,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Henceforward I am your faithful comrade in life and death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whilst the warriors were still at the feast, a messenger from
King Walberan came in, and declared war on Dietrich in the name
of his master, unless Laurin were at once restored to his kingdom,
and unless the hero of Bern sent Walberan all the money and all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
the weapons in the country, as well as the right hand and left foot
of every warrior who had taken part in the destruction of the Rose
Garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich answered proudly, that he intended to keep his money,
arms, hands, and feet, and those of his subjects also.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And tell him,” added Laurin, “that I send him my thanks and
greeting for coming to my assistance, but that I am now free, and
have entered into a bond of love and friendship with the King of
Bern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both sides prepared for battle, but before a blow was struck,
Laurin rode into his uncle’s camp, and tried to make peace
between Walberan and Dietrich. His uncle told him he was no
better than a broken-spirited serf, and refused to listen to his
words. So the fight began, and raged furiously for many hours.
At length, late in the afternoon, Dietrich and Walberan met,
and challenged each other to single combat. It was a terrible
struggle—both kings were severely wounded, and it seemed to the
onlookers as if both must die. Suddenly Laurin threw himself
unarmed between their swords, flung his arms round King Walberan,
and entreated him to make peace. Almost at the same
moment Hildebrand did the same by the angry Dietrich, and after
much expenditure of words, the peacemakers had their way.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the fighting was changed to feasting, and the kings entered
into a friendly alliance at the banquet that evening. The hero of
Bern made a long speech in praise of Laurin, who had endangered
his life in endeavouring to make peace, and to whom he
therefore restored the free and independent rule over his kingdom
and Rose Garden. When he had finished, Queen Virginal came
forward, leading fair Künhild, and laid the hand of the maiden
in that of Laurin, saying that she knew he would regard her
reward of his faithfulness as the greatest he had that day received;
for Künhild had promised to be his wife if her brother did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
object. As no dissentient voice was heard, the marriage was celebrated
there and then.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the May-month of the following year, when the roses were
again in bloom, the dwarfs put the finishing touches to a beautiful
palace, which they had built in the Rose Garden. Many a herdsman
and Alpine hunter has seen it; but to those who go in search
of it from mere curiosity, it remains ever invisible.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this day, Laurin and Künhild show themselves at odd times
in the valleys of Tyrol, and there are people yet alive who are
reported to have had a distant glimpse of the wonderful Rose
Garden.</p>

    <p>KING LAURIN’S FEAST.</p>

    <p class='center mt'><span class='sc'>The Great Rose Garden and Ilsan the Monk.</span></p>

<p class='dc8'>Dietrich was now a man in the
prime of life—a perfect hero, and
man of valour. The number of
his comrades had much increased, and many doughty deeds had
been done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once when the king was feasting with many of his comrades, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
looked round the table with pride, and said he believed that no
ruler on earth had such heroes about him, that no other had prospered
so well as he with the help of his chosen comrades, and
that none might be compared with them. The warriors shouted
their approbation. One alone was silent. The king turned to
him, and asked whether in all his journeys he had seen bolder
warriors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That I have,” cried Herbrand. “I have seen some that have
not their match upon earth. It was at the good town of Worms,
near the River Rhine, in the land of Burgundy. It is there that
the great Rose Garden lies—five miles long by two-and-a-half
broad. The queen and her ladies tend it themselves, and twelve
great warriors keep watch and ward lest any one enter the garden
without the queen’s permission. Whoever does so must fight with
the guard, and no one yet, whether giant or warrior, has been able
to withstand them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us go and pluck the roses that have been watered with the
blood of heroes,” cried Dietrich. “I think that my comrades and I
will get the better of the guard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you mean to try your luck,” said Herbrand, “you must know
that the victor will receive a kiss and a wreath of roses from
lovely women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, well,” said the old master, “for the sake of a rose and a
woman’s kiss I would not risk a single hair of my head or beard.
He who wishes to pluck roses or kiss women will find enough at
Bern; he need not go to the Rhine to find them.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/i_188.jpg' alt='ILSAN TAKES LEAVE OF THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD.' class='ig019' />
<p>ILSAN TAKES LEAVE OF THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Trusty Eckehart and a few more of the comrades agreed with
him, for well they knew what the Burgundian warriors were like.
But Dietrich loudly declared that he was not going to fight for the
sake of roses and kisses, but for honour and fame; and that if
his comrades did not wish to go with him, he could go alone. Of
course, they would not hear of that, and all who were present agreed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
to go. The names of those who thus adventured their lives were:
Dietrich himself, Master Hildebrand, strong Wittich, Henne called
the Grim, Wolfhart, the young heroes Siegestab and Amelung (or
Omlung), Trusty Eckehart, and Hertnit, Prince of the Reussen;
but they only numbered nine in all, and twelve were needed
to meet the twelve watchmen of the garden. Hildebrand knew
what was to be done. He said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Rüdiger of Bechelaren will not refuse to be the tenth;
the eleventh must be brave Dietleib of Styria, and the twelfth
my pious brother, the monk Ilsan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They started forth at once to induce the chosen three to join
them. They went first to Bechelaren, in the land of the Danube.
Rüdiger received them hospitably, and at once consented to go
with them, but said that he must first get leave of absence from
Etzel, whose margrave he was. The heroes then went on to Styria
to visit Dietleib. They did not find him at home, but his father
Biterolf, who was there, earnestly entreated them to give up the
journey to the Rhine, because, he said, only a fool would undertake
a conflict for life or death with the world’s bravest warriors,
for the sake of a rose and a kiss. But when they met the young
hero a short time after, they found him ready to go with them.
This settled, they went on to Münchenzell, the monastery to which
Hildebrand’s brother belonged. As soon as Ilsan heard the object
of their journey, he went straight to the abbot, and asked leave to
accompany the hero of Bern to the Rose Garden. The abbot told
him that such was scarcely a monkish quest, but Ilsan grew so
angry, and so loudly affirmed that valiant deeds were in his eyes
as seemly for a monk as for any other man, that the abbot quailed
before him, and gave him leave to go. So Ilsan donned his
armour under his monkish dress, and started with his friends. His
heart beat high with joy that he was again bound on one of
Dietrich’s adventures, while his brother monks stood by and shook
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
their heads, saying they feared it would not end well, seeing it was
no saintly quest, but a worldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes went first to Bern, which was to be the general
meeting-place. Margrave Rüdiger was the last to arrive, for he
had been detained by his visit to Etzel. Rüdiger was now sent
on before the others as ambassador to King Gibich at Worms, to
inform him of their intended invasion of the Rose Garden. The
Margrave was well known in the Rhineland, and was received as
an old friend by the king, who rejoiced to hear of his leader’s
enterprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The garden was entered on the appointed day, and the warriors
stood opposite each other ready for battle; twelve against twelve,
and yet always one against one. It was a terrible sight, for many
a hero fell dying amongst the roses, and watered them with his
heart’s blood. When proud Wolfhart had slain his adversary, he
contemptuously refused the kiss offered him by a lovely maiden,
and contented himself with the garland of roses. The monk, Ilsan,
walked into the lists on foot, clad in his grey robes. He jumped
about among the roses with such strange agility that his opponent
thought he had a madman to deal with. But he soon found that
his reverend foe was made of sterner metal than he supposed, for
he lay vanquished, a wiser man, though wounded almost to the
death. The victor received the wreath of roses on his tonsured
head, but when he kissed the lovely maid who gave it him, she
shrieked aloud, for his bristly beard had stung her rosy lips.
Seeing this, he said with comical disgust,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The maidens of Rhineland are fair to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>But far too tender to pleasure me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Many other heroes received the prize of victory, while others
were severely wounded. Peace was not concluded until sunset.
The brave hero of Bern soon afterwards returned home, pleased
with the result of his quest.</p>

<h3 id='p1c3s4' class='c020'>IV. DIETRICH, THE FAITHFUL ALLY.</h3>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>March to Etzel.</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Dietrich lived in friendship with Etzel, king of the Huns,
from the time Rüdiger first brought them together. When
the hero came back from Burgundy, he had sent ambassadors
to the king, and promised to help him if he was in any difficulty.
It was not long before he was reminded of this promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Margrave, who was known in all lands by the title of the
good and gentle, came to Bern one day as he had often come
before, for he was a welcome guest. On such occasions the
warriors would talk over their past adventures, and tell tales of
noble and doughty deeds. Rüdiger told amongst other things
of his adventures in Spain, and how he had at last left that
country, and taken service under King Etzel, who had always
been a true friend to him since the beginning of their acquaintance.
He went on to relate how King Etzel, powerful monarch
as he then was, did not shun to speak of the hardships and homelessness
of his early youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, truly,” interrupted Master Hildebrand, “and I know as
much of his early youth as ever the great king himself. Once
when Wilkinus was ruler of the Wilkin-men——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! my great-grandfather!” cried Wittich. “What have you
to say of him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
“I only know,” continued the master, “that he was a mighty
chief, and that many kings were subject to him; amongst others,
King Hertnit. After the death of Wilkinus, Hertnit rebelled
against his son and heir, Nordian, and forced the latter to acknowledge
him as his liege lord. The conquered king obtained
the rule of Zealand in fief, and declared himself satisfied, although
he had four gigantic sons, namely, Asperian, Edgar, Awentrod,
and terrible Widolf of the club, who was always kept chained up,
because he did so much destruction whenever he was in a rage.
When great Hertnit died, he divided his kingdom amongst his
three sons. Osantrix (Oserich) obtained the rule over the Wilkin-men,
Waldemar that over the Reussen, and Ylias became yarl
of the Greeks. The eldest of the three wooed beautiful Oda,
daughter of Melias, king of the Huns. He won her by trickery
and force, with the help of Nordian’s four giant sons. Oda’s father
and husband became allies after the marriage, but they could not
conquer the bold Frisians, who often made raids into the land
of the Huns, and burnt, destroyed, or stole whatever they laid
their hands on. For Melias was old and weak, and the Wilkin-men
lived so far away that their help always arrived too late. The
leader of these bold invaders was the mighty man of valour now
known as King Etzel, or Attila as he is sometimes called. He
was a son of the Frisian chieftain Osid, and after his father’s death
had to allow his brother Ortnit to succeed to the rule of Friesland,
and himself go out into the wide world, with nothing but his
armour and a good sword. But Frisians are a bold and warlike
people. Many of them joined themselves to the young hero, and
accompanied him in his viking raids into the neighbouring land
of the Huns. When Melias died, the notables of the land elected
their former enemy, bold Etzel, to be their king, and thus the
robber chief and invader became the sovereign and protector of
the country he had once laid waste.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
“Yes,” returned Rüdiger, “that is quite true, and there is
more to tell. King Etzel wished to marry Erka (Herche or
Helche), the beautiful daughter of Osantrix, chief of the Wilkin-men.
I was sent as ambassador to her father, and was well
received; but when I told the king the object of my mission, he
grew wrathful, and said that he would never give his consent to
such a marriage, for Etzel was not the rightful chief of the
Huns; adding that the position was his by right of his wife,
the daughter of Melias. He cared not when I threatened him
with war; but desired me to go my way. Etzel invaded the
country with his men; and when, after much fighting, a truce was
at last agreed to, neither side had gained much advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A year later, I went back with a number of brave men, and
had a strong castle built for me in the Falster-wood. This
done, I stained my face, and otherwise disguised by a long
beard, went again to visit Osantrix. I told him I was a faithful
servant of the late King Melias, that I had been ill-treated and
deprived of my lands by Etzel, and had therefore taken refuge
with him. This story gained me his confidence, and having
occasion to send his daughter Erka a message, he made me his
ambassador. I told the maiden of Etzel’s wooing, and how he
wished to share his power and glory with her. At first she was
very angry, but at last consented to marry him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One moonlight night, I brought horses to the gates of the
fortress where she was shut up with her young sister; broke
the bars, and carried off the princesses. We were pursued, but
managed to reach the castle in the wood where my men were
awaiting me. I had scarcely time to send a message to Etzel,
when Osantrix came upon us with all his host. He laid siege
to our stronghold; but we managed to defend ourselves till
Etzel came with a great army, and forced the Wilkin-men to
withdraw. Ever since then, there has been a constant predatory
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
warfare between the two nations, and Osantrix has even now
invaded our land with a large army. He is accompanied by
Nordian’s giant sons, who are the terror of our people. Now,
noble Dietrich, Etzel thinks that if you will come and help him,
he is sure of victory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah well! If my dear comrade Wildeber will go with me,”
cried Wittich, “I think that we two shall be able to reckon with
the giants.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich promised his help, and ordered all preparations to be
made for the campaign. The Bernese heroes arrived just in time,
for the two armies were standing opposite each other in battle
array. The fight began.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich and his men took up their position in the centre division.
The Amelung banner, borne by Herbrand, floated proudly
above their heads, and Wittich rushed foremost into the fray. He
first encountered the grim giant Widolf, who gave him a blow on
the helmet with his iron club. The dragon that formed the top of
the helmet was bent by the terrible blow, and although Wieland’s
work did not break, the hero himself fell from his horse, and lay
senseless on the ground. Over him rushed the men-at-arms in
the wild <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i>. Heime alone drew rein. He stooped, and drew
the sword Mimung out of Wittich’s hand, for he held him to be
dead. When the wild fight was over and done, the Wilkin-men
retreated from the field, and the Huns pursued them, plundering
where they could. Hertnit, nephew of Osantrix, reached the
battle-field too late. He could not prevent his uncle’s defeat,
but he found Wittich, as yet scarcely recovered from his swoon,
and took him prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The victors feasted at Susat, and rejoiced over their great
deeds; but Dietrich was sad at heart, for he had lost sixty of
his men; and, worst than all, his friend and comrade, Wittich, was
among the missing. In vain had they sought him on the battle-field.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
All wondered what had become of him. When the king
of Bern, richly rewarded for his help by Etzel, made ready for
his departure, Wildeber came to him, and asked for leave of
absence, because he would not, could not, go home without
Wittich. Dietrich willingly gave his consent, for he could not
help the foolish hope springing up within his breast that perhaps
Wittich might be yet alive, and that his friend might find
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day, Wildeber went out hunting, and slew a bear of
unusual size. He skinned it, and went with the skin to Isung,
the minstrel, and arranged with him a plan to free Wittich, should
he be a prisoner in the hands of Osantrix. Isung helped him to
draw the skin over his armour, and fasten it up carefully; then
led him in the guise of a dancing bear to the stronghold of the
chief of the Wilkin-men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now wandering players and merry-andrews, of every sort,
were welcome guests in all castles and cottages, so Isung and
his bear were well received.</p>

<p class='c007'>Osantrix laughed heartily at the marvellous agility of the
creature in dancing and springing to the sound of the fiddle, and
even Widolf, the grim giant, who was led about with a chain by
his brother Awentrod, laughed for the first time in his life,
making the halls shake with the sound. Suddenly it occurred
to the king that it would enhance the sport to set his twelve
boar-hounds on the bear, to see how strong it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>Isung vainly entreated the king to forbear the cruel sport,
alleging that his tame bear was worth more to him than all the
gold in the royal treasury; but Osantrix was not to be persuaded.
The great dogs were loosed, and the barbarous sport began. To
the astonishment of all, the boar-hounds were either worried or
smitten to death by the bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Osantrix sprang angrily to his feet, and slashed at the creature’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
shoulder with his sword; but the steel armour under inside the
bear-skin saved the hero’s life. Another moment, and the bear
had wrenched the sword from the king’s hand, and split his head
open. The second blow did to death grim Widolf, the third his
brother Awentrod. Isung stood staunchly by his friend when
the Wilkin-men sought to avenge their king. The courtiers, however,
soon took flight in deadly fear of the player and his wild
beast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wildeber now threw off the bear-skin, took the helmet off
one of the giants, and fully armed, set out in search of Wittich.
The heroes searched the palace. They found Wittich’s good
steed Skeming, and his armour; but neither him nor the sword
Mimung could they discover.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length they lighted on him in a damp, dark dungeon,
chained to a wall, and grown so pale and thin as to be hardly
recognisable. Fresh air, food, and wine soon made a change in
his appearance. He put on his armour, and sadly took another
sword, saying that none could be as good as Mimung.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now let us begone,” said Isung, “lest the Wilkin-men should
come back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Wildeber and he helped themselves to horses from the
royal stables, and the three heroes galloped away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of a truth,” cried King Etzel, when he heard their story,
“you are bold men. You have done me good service, and have
brought the war to an end unaided. The lord of Bern is richer
than I, in that he has comrades who willingly venture their own
lives to serve a brother-in-arms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He kept the heroes for several days to recruit their strength,
and then sent them home laden with rich gifts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich was overjoyed to see his brave warriors again, and
showed them honour in many ways; but noticing that trusty
Wittich was silent, and had no appetite for wine or food, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
asked him what ailed him. And Wittich answered that he
sorrowed for the loss of Mimung, his father’s best gift, and
would go in search of it though he had to wander through
every land.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a notion that you need not take so long a journey,”
replied the king, “for I cannot help thinking that the sword
Heime wears is as like Wieland’s work as one drop of blood is
like another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of two warriors
in rich armour, who had been sent by the Emperor Ermenrich,
Dietrich’s uncle, to tell the hero that Yarl Rimstein, his vassal
in a great fief, had revolted against his authority. Ermenrich,
therefore, entreated his nephew’s aid, and Dietrich promised to
help the emperor.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>March against Rimstein.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Before starting, Wittich said that he could not go to Rimstein
without his sword, and Heime refused to give it up, alleging
that it was his by right of war; but the king smoothed matters
for the time by desiring Heime to lend it to his comrade during
the campaign.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warriors set out. The rebel yarl proved himself a tougher
foe than had been expected, and even after weeks and months
had passed, his castle seemed as impregnable as ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>One moonlight night when Wittich was out alone, he met six
warriors whom he knew, by the device upon their shields, to
belong to the enemy. They fought, and Wittich slew their chief,
his sword Mimung cutting him in two from the neck to the
waist. The other five fled in terror, lest a like fate should befall
them. On examining the dead man, Wittich found it was the
yarl himself that he had slain, so he returned to the camp well
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
pleased. Next morning he told Dietrich and his comrades what
had chanced, and how the war was now at an end.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is indeed a bold warrior,” said Heime sarcastically; “he
has slain a weak old man, who could not defend himself a bit
better than a woman. But now, I must have Mimung back again,
for I only lent it for this enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me first try it on your head, false comrade,” answered
Wittich indignantly. “You left your brother-in-arms to die in a
strange land, and were traitor enough to rob him of his weapon
of defence as well. You shall now pay the penalty of your
meanness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Heime drew his sword Nagelring, and a fight was imminent;
but Dietrich thrust himself between the angry men, and commanded
them on their allegiance to keep the peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ermenrich rejoiced to hear of Wittich’s deed, and that the war
was at an end. He gave rich presents to Dietrich and his men,
and asked the royal hero to give Wittich leave of absence, that
he might marry fair Bolfriana, the emperor’s ward, and undertake
the government of her rich fief of Drachenfels (the “Trekanfil”
of Norse legend). Dietrich was pleased at his comrade’s good
fortune, and at parting, he merely reminded him of his oath of
fidelity, which the hero at once renewed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long afterwards Wittich was married to Bolfriana, and
was endowed by the emperor with the great fief of Drachenfels,
which extends to Fritilaburg (Friedburg?), and far beyond the
eastern mountains. So Wittich became a mighty chief, as he
had told his father that he would. Heime also, when his father
Studas died, went to Ermenrich’s court to take the oath of allegiance.
He received other lands from his imperial master, and,
what he liked still better, much red gold besides.</p>

    <h3 id='p1c3s5'>V.<br />
    ERMENRICH TURNS AGAINST THE HERO OF BERN.</h3>

    <p class='center'><span class='sc'>The Harlungs.</span></p>

<p class='dc9'>Ermenrich had a great and
mighty empire. His lands
stretched out to the east and west, and many kings owed him
fealty. His counsellors were wise and clear-headed men, whose
advice was of the utmost use to him. Chief among these was
Sibich, the marshal of the realm, who was helped in his arduous
labours by Ribestein, the head of the royal household, and his
constant companion. These men had always used their influence
with the emperor to keep him true to his alliance with his
nephew, the king of Bern, of whom, in his heart of hearts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
his imperial highness was not a little jealous. But a great
change was soon to take place in the policy pursued at Romaburg.</p>
<p class='c007'>Sibich had a young and beautiful wife, of whom he was very
fond. Now Ermenrich once sent him away on a long journey,
and during his absence did him foul wrong. When the marshal
returned, and heard from his weeping wife of the emperor’s
treachery, he was filled with wrath. At first, he snatched up a
dagger to kill his foe, but restrained himself, for he had thought
of a subtler mode of vengeance. He desired to make the
emperor the murderer of every member of his family, to deprive
him of all his allies, and finally have him assassinated. It was
a plan worthy of the devil himself, and was carried out with great
craft and intelligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sibich’s first step was to buy over Ribestein to his design,
which he did for a large sum of money, avarice being the man’s
weak point. This done, Ribestein agreed to write letters to the
emperor as if from the duke of Tuscany, the count of Ancona,
the prince of Milan, and others, warning him that his son Friedrich
was plotting against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evil deed was easily accomplished, as Ribestein had copies
of all the coats of arms and seals used by the grandees of the
empire. Ermenrich was naturally of a suspicious disposition, so
he readily fell into the snare laid for him. He consulted Sibich
as to what were best to be done, and the false counsellor advised
him to send Prince Friedrich with a letter to Yarl Randolt,
ostensibly to demand payment of the tribute the yarl owed, but
really containing an order that the prince should be slain. The
emperor did as he was advised, and Sibich took care that the
deed should become generally known. A cry of horror went
through the land, and Ermenrich was hated by all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reginbald, the second son, met his death in a different fashion:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
he went down in the rotten ship in which his father had sent
him on a pretended mission to England.</p>

<p class='c007'>One son alone remained, Randwer, the third and youngest,
a high-spirited, handsome youth, in whom there was no guile.
That helped him nothing, however. One day, in the innocence
of his heart, he gave his young step-mother Swanhild a bunch
of flowers, when they were out hunting with the whole court,
and Ermenrich, whose mind had been poisoned by false Sibich,
ordered Swanhild to be trampled under foot by horses, and
Randwer to be hung. His commands were obeyed. He was
now alone in the world, a childless old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Ribestein,” said the marshal to his accomplice, “we
are getting on very well. The emperor’s only remaining heirs
are the Harlungs, Imbreke and Fritele, who live at Breisach,
on the Rhine, with their governor Eckehart; and then Dietrich
of Bern. The Harlungs and the hero are both brother’s children.
You were not born and brought up in Romaburg, so I will tell
you the story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ermenrich’s grandfather left two sons besides him—namely,
Dietmar, the father of Dietrich, who received the kingdom of
Lombardy, and Dieter, surnamed Harlung, who during his
father’s lifetime received the Breisgau and an enormous hoard
of red gold. Now listen to this. If we can only get rid of the
Harlungs and the hero of Bern—yes, open your eyes and ears
as wide as you can—you and I can divide between us the inheritance
of Ermenrich!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ribestein jumped at the proposal as a fish jumps out of the
water with joy on a bright day. He had never thought of such
a thing before; but he quickly understood what was required
of him, and set about the evil work at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Harlungs were first brought under suspicion. Letters
were shown to the emperor purporting to be from Imbreke,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
Fritele, and even from their governor Eckehart, addressed to
different notables of the empire, and setting forth Ermenrich’s
crimes in the darkest colours. One of the letters contained the
following passage: “Since our liege lord has, in his desperate
wickedness, slain his own children, he must himself perish, and
that on the highest gallows.” The emperor was so angry when
he read these words, that he determined to collect an army, and
march against his rebellious nephews.</p>

<p class='c007'>The troops were called out without any one knowing against
whom the campaign was to be made. They marched towards
the Rhine till they reached Tralenburg, which belonged to the
Harlungs and where the brothers then lived. Two horsemen
kept watch by the river. When they saw the armed men, they
feared something was wrong, and, dismounting, swam with their
horses across the river. They gave the alarm, and all was
prepared for defence. Imbreke and Fritele knew the science of
war; but they were still very young, and Eckehart, their governor,
was detained at Breisach by business of the state. When the
Harlungs saw their uncle’s banner, they thought all danger was
over; but soon found to their cost that it was a warlike and
not a peaceful visit. Wittich and Heime were with the imperial
army; but as soon as they learnt Ermenrich’s plans they rode
away to Breisach to warn the faithful Eckehart of what was
going on. As they journeyed together, they became good friends
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tralenburg was at length reduced by fire and taken by storm.
Without seeing his nephews, Ermenrich ordered a gallows to
be erected, and the two brothers to be at once hung thereon.
In those days the word of a mighty potentate was law, and the
emperor was obeyed without remonstrance. Ermenrich now took
possession of the Harlungs’ land, and sent out men to search
for the rich hoard the murdered princes had inherited from their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
father. It was at length found hidden in a cave. The emperor
rewarded his army richly, and kept the rest of the treasure-trove
for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Heime had returned. He had come back intending
to reproach his liege lord with his evil deed, and to throw
up his fief. But on receiving a large share of the booty, he forgot
his better purpose. He was entrusted with the care of taking
the treasure to Romaburg. When he saw the heap of red gold
and precious stones, he took care that a considerable portion of
it should find its way to Studa’s grange, and not to Romaburg.
Meanwhile curses both loud and deep were uttered in every land
against the emperor. Eckehart brought the news of the Harlungs’
fate to Bern, and Dietrich’s wrath burned when he heard it. He
said the time would surely come when he could demand expiation
from Ermenrich, and punish his evil counsellors Sibich and
Ribestein. The fiery young heroes Alphar and his brother
Sigestab wished to start at once alone with Eckehart to avenge
the murder. But their father Amelolt and Hildebrand persuaded
them to wait.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is only put off may yet be done,” said Alphar to his
brother, laying his hand upon his sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somewhere about this time Sibich and Ribestein met to hold
counsel as to what they should do next.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another stone is out of the way,” said Sibich; “now we
must try to find levers strong enough to move the great rock
that stands in our way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The accomplices felt that they must be careful and not push
matters too fast, for, in the first place, the emperor’s own soul
was darkened by the crimes he had committed, and whenever he
was alone he was haunted by the unsubstantial ghosts of those
whose death he had compassed,—and, in the second place, before
declaring war upon the hero of Bern, they felt it would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
safer to gain over as many as possible of his comrades to their
side. But they were hurried on faster than they wished, for
Ermenrich’s uneasy conscience would not let him rest—he must
have excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first step taken was to demand tribute of Dietrich of
Bern. So Reinhold of Milan was sent into the land of the
Amelungs to levy the tribute. The messenger returned in a
few weeks’ time with empty hands. He said that the notables
had flatly refused to pay what he demanded, for they had already
paid it to the lord of Bern. And Dietrich had desired him to
tell the murderer of the Harlungs to come himself and take the
tribute, which would be paid him to the last mark at the spear’s
point and the sword’s edge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor sent Heime to Bern to tell Dietrich that if he
did not pay the tax, he would come in person and hang him on
the highest gallows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heime was well received in Bern. Dietrich thought that he had
come in memory of old times, but when he delivered the emperor’s
message, the hero asked him if he remembered his old oath of
fidelity; to which Heime replied that he had served out his bond,
that he was now a vassal of the emperor, who had given him land
and gold, and to whom he therefore owed service. Therewith
he took his leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heime was not long gone, when Wittich appeared. He galloped
up to the castle gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Arm, comrades, arm!” he cried, “there is not a moment to
lose. Ermenrich approaches with an innumerable army. I rode
on before to warn you of his coming. Faithless Sibich intended
to have taken you by surprise, and whoever falls into his hands
is not far from death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich reminded him of his oath, but like Heime he excused
himself, and rode away.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
The Norns appeared at this time to have thrown their darkest
web over the head of the hero of Bern. One blow struck him
after another. From Wittich he hastened to the sick queen
Virginal. All night long he held her in his arms. In the
morning she died, and grief for her loss prevented his acting with
the quick determination usual to him. Master Hildebrand, however,
was not idle. He had summoned all the vassals with their
following from far and wide in the land of the Amelungs. And
the night before the queen’s death, many allied princes joined
them; amongst the number, Berchtung of Pola (in Istria), and
the king’s faithful comrade, Dietleib of Styria, with all their
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning the old master called the king, and told him
that the time was come to fight for his land and people. The
hero of Bern made a mighty effort to master his grief. He pressed
a last kiss on the pale lips of his dead wife, and passed away
on his march to the great battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor had already subdued the duke of Spoleto, and had
advanced as far north as Milan. There he encamped, and not
suspecting any surprise, he and his men all went to sleep. Meanwhile
Dietrich had arrived within a short distance of his camp.
While the others rested, Hildebrand rode forward to see what
watch the enemy kept, and finding them unprepared, he advised
an immediate onslaught.</p>

<p class='c007'>The imperial forces were suddenly aroused by the battle cry,
“Hey for Bern! Hey for the red lion!” They hastily got ready
for the fray. The battle raged furiously. Dietrich and his
followers were far outnumbered by the foe, but that only made
them fight with the more desperation. And which of them could
have failed to do his duty under such a leader?</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfhart cried, “If we <em>must</em> die, let each man throw his shield
behind him, and take his sword in both hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
He did as he said, and Sigestab and Eckehart followed his
example.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wittich and Heime fought bravely as of old, but they avoided
their former chief, and were at length carried away in the general
flight. For the imperial troops were routed by a flank movement
made by Hildebrand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ermenrich went back to Romaburg in a very bad humour. He
felt inclined to hang Sibich and Ribestein for leading him into
a scrape, yet he refrained, as he hardly knew what he could have
done without them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich sent the treasure gained in Milan home to Bern under
the charge of some of his comrades, and Berchtung of Pola
undertook to provide pack-horses on which to convey it. The
convoy travelled by forced marches, but when they reached the
lake of Garden, and saw the stars mirrored in its bosom, and heard
the plashing of the waterfall, Amelolt thought, that being in the
land of the Wolfings, they need no longer fear robbers, and might
enjoy a little needful rest. The wearied men hailed his proposition
with joy, and, after supping on the provisions in their wallets, soon
fell asleep on the soft turf. Hildebrand with ten of his followers
tried to keep awake, but they were so tired that the sound of the
murmuring water acted on them like a lullaby, and soon they were
sleeping as soundly as the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>At daybreak they were roughly wakened. Wild faces glared
upon them, strong hands bound them, and scornful laughter
echoed in their ears. Four of the warriors, who had sought to
defend themselves sword in hand, were cut down. The others
were all bound and carried away with the treasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had not been prisoners long before the comrades saw that
they had fallen into the hands of their deadly enemy—faithless
Sibich. He had heard of their journey in charge of the treasure,
and had brought his troops by sea to Garden, had lain in wait
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
near the lake, and had then fallen upon the sleeping men. Thus
it was that the brave heroes were conquered by cunning.</p>

<p class='c007'>One warrior had escaped the common misfortune, and this was
Dietleib, the hero of Styria. He was sleeping in a thicket a little
apart from the rest, when Sibich’s men fell on the camp. Hearing
the noise, he sprang to his feet, slew several of the men-at-arms,
mounted his horse and fled to Bern, a bearer of sad tidings. He
found every one there in great anxiety. Ermenrich had again
invaded the country, had taken Milan, Raben (Ravenna), and
Mantua, and, worse than that, many of Dietrich’s men had deserted
him, and joined the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warriors who preserved their faith, and were determined
to die with their lord if needful, were few in number. A message
was sent to Ermenrich that the hero of Bern was willing to
exchange his prisoners of war for his brave comrades. The
answer he received was, that he might do with his prisoners as
he liked—the warriors the emperor had taken were all condemned
to be hanged. This was the worst news Dietrich had ever
heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the lady Ute, Hildebrand’s high-hearted wife, arose, and,
accompanied by other noble ladies, went to the enemy’s camp and
entered the presence of Ermenrich. She offered him in exchange
for the prisoners Sibich had just made, all her jewels, and those
of all the other women and maidens of Bern. Ermenrich told her
harshly that what she offered him was his already, and that if the
king wished his comrades to be set free, he and they must leave
the country as beggars, on foot, and leading their horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hildebrand's wife could not bear to hear that. She had fallen
on her knees before the emperor; but now she rose, and told him
proudly that the heroes of Bern and their wives knew how to die,
but not how to leave their country in dishonour. The women left
the camp in deep sorrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
When Dietrich heard the bad news, he had a long struggle with
himself. He had been victorious before with smaller numbers
to support him, but victory was always uncertain, and how could
he allow his dear old master, and noble Berchtung, brave
Wolfhart, Amelolt, Sigeband, Helmschrot, and Lindolt, to die
a shameful death? It was a hard struggle. At length he bowed
his head to necessity. He consented to Ermenrich’s terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>On being set free from prison, his comrades received their horses
and arms again, and then they, and other faithful souls, three
and forty men in all, accompanied their lord on his sad journey.
There was not a dry eye in Bern when the king went away, and
even in foreign lands the fate of Dietrich and his comrades was
spoken of with bated breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes would not mount their horses when they had crossed
the borders of the imperial domains, for the king walked on
unheeding over the wild mountain roads. So the small band
of brave men wandered through the beautiful Danubian land,
and approached Bechelaren, where Margrave Rüdiger held court.
There they received a brotherly welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, when they had been some time at Bechelaren,
Dietrich, who had been thinking of the contrast between his
desolated home and the smiling land he saw before him, said,
with a deep sigh, that everywhere around him was peace and
unity, and he would like to remain there for ever and forget his
woes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wolfhart reproached him vehemently for wishing to forget his
home, adding, “If that is the case, I shall go back and fight till
my last drop of blood is shed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not so fast, young hero,” answered the Margrave, “King Etzel
owes thanks for the help once granted him. I will go with you
to the court at Susat, and am certain that he will help you to
regain the land of the Amelungs.”</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
<h3 id='p1c3s6' class='c020'>VI. KING ETZEL, WALTER OF WASGENSTEIN, AND HILDEGUNDE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >When Etzel became king of the Huns, he was the
mightiest of all chieftains, but his lust of power was not
satisfied. He collected a great army, and falling upon the land
of the Franks, demanded tribute with threats of devastation.
The Frankish king was unprepared to defend himself, so he
paid large sums of money, and gave as hostage for his good
faith, the boy Hagen of Tronje (Tronege). His own son was
too young, being yet in the cradle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Huns went on to Burgundy, where they also levied
tribute, and received as hostage the king’s daughter Hildegunde,
a child of four years old. They were equally successful
with King Alphar of Aquitaine, who paid them much red gold,
and gave them his young son Walter as hostage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen and Walter early showed great warlike ability. They
learnt from the Huns to ride, throw the spear, and fight after
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
the German fashion, and few could equal them in manly sports.
Hildegunde became very lovely, and was a great favourite with
the queen. Time went on, and these young people all grew up.
Helche advised her husband to marry Hagen and Walter to
Hunnish maidens of high degree, so as to confirm them
in their devotion to himself, and their adopted country; but
the youths did not admire the beauties of that nation, whose
blubber-lips did not provoke a kiss. Walter was more attracted
by slender Hildegunde’s rosy mouth, fair curls, and blue eyes,
than by any of the daughters of the land; and he was more
pleasing in her eyes than the bow-legged Hun whom the queen
desired her to marry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the Franks and Burgundians had thrown off the
yoke of the Huns, and Etzel did not dare to enforce it in
the then condition of affairs. Hagen one day found out what
had chanced, and, according to one account, he made his escape
to his own people, but, according to another, was sent home
loaded with honours. But Etzel did his best to keep Walter
with him, for he knew his bravery and worth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once when the king returned with his warriors from conquering
an invading horde, he gave a great feast, and asked
Hildegunde to sing him a song. The maiden complied, and
sang about her old home and her mother, and how she trusted
to return to them once more, when the hero came for whom
she waited. Etzel did not take in the sense of her song, as she
had expected; he had raised the wine-cup to his lips too often
for that. But Queen Helche understood, and determined to
watch Walter and the maiden, lest they should fly together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walter, too, had understood the meaning of the song, and
soon found an opportunity of arranging matters with Hildegunde
regarding their flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not sleep to-night,” he whispered one evening, “but slip
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
into the treasure-chamber, and take as much gold and silver
as you can carry out of the seventh chest; it is part of the
tribute money that your father and mine paid the Huns long
ago. Put the money you have taken in two caskets, and
bring them down to the hall. You will find me waiting for
you at the gate with two saddled horses. We shall be gone
a long time before the drunken Huns find out that we have
escaped them.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
They carried out Walter’s plan in every particular, and made
their way to Bechelaren first, then to the Rhine, and finally to
the mountains of Wasgengau (Vosges), in the highest of which,
the Wasgenstein, they found a cave with such a narrow entrance
that one man could there defend himself against an army.
Walter wished to rest awhile, for he had had but little sleep
during their long and toilsome journey, so he asked the maiden
to keep watch, lest a sudden attack should be made upon
them. He had not been long asleep when Hildegunde saw
the sheen of armour in the distance. She wakened the hero,
telling him that the Huns were upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These are not Huns, but Burgundians,” he answered, starting
to his feet. And he found they were messengers sent by King
Gunther, to demand that the treasure should be given up to
him. Walter offered to hand over a shield full of gold, but this
was refused, and the fray began. But the assailants could only
approach one at a time; so the hero, who had learnt from the
Huns to throw the javelin, was able to kill them one after
the other with these missiles, and, when they failed, with his
sword. Hagen had come with Gunther’s men, but he stood
apart during the fight, siding with neither party; only when
he saw his friends falling fast, his hand involuntarily sought his
sword, but he did not draw it. He returned to the king, and
advised him to try an ambush.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day, as Walter and Hildegunde were continuing their
journey across the open country, they were set upon by two
men in complete armour, who sprang out upon them from
behind a clump of bushes. They were Hagen and King Gunther.
Despairing of flight, Walter leapt off his horse, and they
did the same. With wonderful agility, he dodged, now to the
right, now to the left, to avoid their blows; at length his sword
cut through one of King Gunther’s greaves, and the edge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
entered the bone of the leg. He stood over the fallen king,
and was about to deal him a death-blow, when a stroke from
Hagen disabled his sword-arm. He dropt the sword, but with
his left hand drew his dagger, and plunged it into Hagen’s eye.
Seeing them all three disabled, Hildegunde came forward to
propose a truce, and bound up all their wounds; after which
she and Walter went on their way in peace. They arrived at
Aquitaine without further adventure, and were there married.
The young hero in later days always took part with the Burgundians
and Ermenrich, as we saw before when Dietleib challenged
him at Romaburg.</p>

<h3 id='p1c3s7' class='c020'>VII. ETZEL AND DIETRICH AGAINST THE REUSSEN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >But now we must return to Dietrich and Etzel. When the
hero of Bern desired Etzel’s help in freeing the land of
the Amelungs from the tyranny of the usurper, he found that
it was impossible for the latter to grant it. His hands were
already overfull with his own quarrels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Waldemar, king of the Reussen, and brother of that Osantrix
whom Etzel had formerly slain, and whose daughter he had
married, now invaded his borders, and threatened to overrun
the country. In truth, Etzel needed Dietrich’s help, and the
latter did not hesitate to grant it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The war lasted a long time. Many men were slain, and
much fair land was devastated before the invaders were forced
to retire. Dietrich himself was so severely wounded that it
was some time before he felt like himself again. There was
one thing which happened during the war that saddened and
shamed honest Margrave Rüdiger, and that was the remembrance
of the way in which Etzel had on one occasion fled
before Waldemar, thereby proving the latter the better man.
Indeed every one felt that the defeat of the Reussen was owing
more to the leadership and heroism of the hero of Bern than
to any other cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
Etzel pursued the enemy within their own borders, and
forced them to pay him tribute.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich was held in high honour by the Huns, but they did
not see the advantage of helping him to regain his own land,
and he felt sad at heart. At last Queen Helche thought of a
way to make him happy. She proposed to give him her beautiful
niece Herrat to wife, and then they might rule together
over the princess’s fair land of Transylvania. Dietrich and
Herrat made no objection to the marriage, which was soon
afterwards celebrated. But Etzel erred in thinking that the
hero of Bern would ever be content to sink into the position
of a vassal of the Hunnish empire. Neither he nor Herrat were
made of such slight stuff, and Etzel was obliged after all to
give the help he had before refused.</p>

<h3 id='p1c3s8' class='c020'>VIII. THE RAVEN-FIGHT (BATTLE OF RAVENNA).</h3>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Dietrich goes to Bern.</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >“Going back to Bern! Dietrich is going to Bern! We
are to have a campaign in Lombardy,” was the cry which
rang through the land of the Huns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes; Dietrich was really going back, accompanied by many
brave comrades new and old, and at the head of a large army.
Even Etzel’s two sons, mere boys as they were, insisted on going
too. The line of march lay through the great mountains and fair
plains of Lombardy. Amelolt (Amelung) and Hildebrand, at the
head of the Wölfings, stormed Garden, and took the fortress.
But the old master had not time to stay and embrace the Lady
Ute and his son Hadubrand, for they were not in the castle at the
time, and he had to rejoin the army without delay. He came
up with the rest at Padauwe (Padua), which Dietrich failed to
subdue. The army, leaving Padauwe behind it, moved on to
Bern, from which Dietrich heard that Ermenrich’s men had been
expelled by the citizens.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the hero was at home in his beloved Bern, where
he was received with great rejoicings. He had not long to rest;
for a few days after his arrival, Alpher came, bringing a message
from Duke Friedrich of Raben (Ravenna), that the Emperor
Ermenrich was besieging his town, therefore he begged the hero’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
assistance. The Bernese forces made a rapid march, and arrived
unexpectedly in the neighbourhood of the imperial army.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was of no use to send out scouts. The foe lay hidden in
every thicket. Dietrich asked his heroes which of them would
undertake to gain the enemy’s outpost, and immediately young
Alphart, the Lady Ute’s foster-son, declared himself ready.
Others wished to have the duty; but he had spoken first, and
it was given to him.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Alphart’s Death.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The youthful hero rode on towards the dangerous outposts.
Suddenly, spears and arrows rained round him, and fell rattling
from helm and shield. But they did no harm, for his armour had
been made by dwarfs. The enemy’s leader rode up to him, and
desired him to yield, saying that he might give him his sword
without shame, for he was Duke Wölfing, and would return the
weapon to Alphart when he was ransomed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” cried the hero, “are you Duke Wölfing, the only
traitor of our race? You shall have your wages here to-day, and
from my hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The combat between the two men was short. Alphart slew his
opponent. Upon this, the duke’s retainers hastened up to avenge
him, but the young hero killed half of them, and put the rest to
flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A spirit from the nethermost hell has come to fight for Dietrich,”
cried the men-at-arms. “It slew more than fifty of us
single-handed, and we ourselves hardly escaped with our lives.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you not know that the hero of Bern is a son of the devil?”
was the answer; “and what is more natural than that a father
should come to his child’s assistance? No mortal man can be
expected to fight with such a foe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
“I will go out and see if it be not made of flesh and blood,”
cried stout Wittich. “Even though it had all hell at its back, I
care not; I must have a turn with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He armed himself quickly, and caught up a sword without
noticing that it was not Mimung. Heime, whose life he had saved
a short time before, offered to go with him, and avenge him should
he fall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alphart recognised the men from a distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye are two faithless comrades,” he cried, “and have come to
meet your doom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The combat between him and Wittich began forthwith, and
the latter soon perceived that he had not Mimung. He was twice
felled to the ground. In his sore distress, he called on his comrade
to help him; but Heime hesitated, because it was considered
dishonourable for two warriors to fight against one. When
Alphart, however, called upon Wittich to yield, if he would not
be slain on the spot, Heime sprang forward, and covered his
comrade with his shield, thus enabling him to get to his feet again.
After which both warriors attacked the young hero.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alphart was as active on foot as he was strong of hand. He
felled Heime, but Wittich came to his help, and so the battle went
on. The three warriors bled from many wounds; but it was
Heime’s hand that finally dealt the death-blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Faithless comrades that ye are,” sighed the dying Alphart,
“the curse of your dishonourable deeds will follow you to the
grave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conquerors left the place of combat in silence. They
did not noise abroad the fame of their deed. Yet their armour
was bloody, and they were sorely wounded. The men-at-arms
whispered in mysterious tones:</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have been fighting with that spirit from hell, have slain
it, but have seen some terrible sight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
The news of Alphart’s death was received with deep sorrow
in the Bernese camp. Dietrich prepared to offer battle to the
emperor on the following day, and made all necessary dispositions
in case he fell in the fight.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Battle.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Master Hildebrand held watch. Not contented with keeping
a distant look-out on the enemy’s movements, he went to see with
his own eyes what was passing within their lines. A thick mist
covered the earth, and hid every object from view. Suddenly the
old master and his companion, Eckehart, heard the tramp of
a horse. They drew their swords, and waited. At the same
moment the moon broke through the mist, and they recognised
by its light Rinold of Milan, who, although one of Ermenrich’s
men, was at the same time a friend of theirs. They greeted each
other heartily, and Rinold said that if he might advise Dietrich,
he would counsel him to return to the land of the Huns, where
he had made himself a home; for the emperor was too powerful
to be overthrown.</p>

<p class='c007'>After taking leave of their friend, Hildebrand looked about
carefully, and discovered a path leading through a wood by which
he could outflank the imperial forces unperceived. On his return
to the camp, he arranged with Dietrich that he should take three
divisions by this path, and fall upon the enemy at daybreak.
Meantime, the king was to be ready to attack in front, the
moment he heard Hildebrand’s horn sound to the rear of the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner had the sun risen than the battle began. Great
deeds of valour were done on either side. It were an endless task
to tell of each hero’s achievements. Among those who fell were
the two young sons of Etzel, who showed themselves worthy of
their name.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
During the course of that day, Dietrich and Wittich met at
last, and it was in this wise. Twilight was drawing on apace,
when Wittich, led by his evil star, or by his companion, Rinold of
Milan, went back to visit the outpost. Dietrich saw them go,
and, remounting, galloped across the valley towards the height,
and the other two turned to meet him. When Wittich saw the
king riding towards him, his face distorted by the angry spirit
that possessed him, and his breath issuing from his mouth like
flames of fire, a terror he had never known before overmastered
him. He turned his horse and fled, followed by Rinold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Halt, cowards, halt!” cried the king. “Two against one!
surely ye are strong enough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Halt, comrade!” said Rinold, “I cannot bear the shame of
this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wittich turned; but no sooner did he see the terrible face and
flaming breath of his old leader, than he fled once more, leaving
Rinold alone to bear the brunt of the attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop, traitor,” shouted Dietrich. “You have the sword
Mimung in your hand, with which you once conquered me at
Bern, and do you now fear to stand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Wittich, by encouraging words, and a free use of the spur,
urged his noble steed to a yet swifter pace. The king did the
same, and Falcon was even fleeter than Wittich’s gallant charger.
The surf might now be heard beating on the sea-shore. The
fugitive warrior reached the strand. He could fly no farther.
And behold, at the same moment, two white arms and a woman’s
head rose out of the waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wachilde—ancestress—save me—hide me from that spirit
of hell,” he cried, and took the terrible leap.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Wachilde received him in her arms, and bore him to her
crystal hall at the bottom of the sea. Dietrich did not hesitate
to follow. The waters swept over him and his horse, but Falcon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
rose again and swam through the roaring surf to the shore. The
king looked all about, but Wittich had vanished. He could see
nothing but the foaming waves. Sadly the king returned to the
camp, having found neither the vengeance nor the death he had
sought.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Huns declared that they would return home as soon as
they had buried their princes with fitting honour. Dietrich heard
their determination unmoved. He was thinking of those who
had fallen. Master Hildebrand, on the other hand, did what he
could to induce them to follow up the victory that they had
gained the previous day; but it was labour lost. They had had
enough of fighting at the battle of Ravenna.</p>

<p class='c007'>Broken-hearted, Dietrich returned to King Etzel, by whom he
was received with the greatest kindness, in spite of all that had
come and gone. He sank into a state of sorrowful brooding and
melancholy, until at length Herrat, his faithful wife, came to
him, and spoke words of comfort and encouragement. And he
roused from his dull woe, and started again for fair Lombardy,
accompanied by the Queen.</p>

</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>To Garden.</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >The King, Queen, and the old Master took leave of Etzel,
who was too sad about the death of his boys to take much
interest in their coming or going.</p>

<p class='c007'>The travellers at length came to a wooded hill with a castle
perched on the top. This castle belonged to a robber-knight
named Elsung, who had always been an enemy of the Amelungs
and Wölfings. The old master, who acted as guide, and led the
way, bade the king be prepared. He did not speak a moment
too soon, for Elsung at the same instant appeared, followed by
some horsemen. The robber-knight drew rein, and haughtily
demanded, as toll from the travellers, their horses and armour,
Hildebrand’s long beard, and the beautiful woman who accompanied
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We need our horses and armour that we may fight in the
land of the Amelungs,” said Hildebrand, “and we cannot spare
the woman, for she acts as our cook.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, then, you are Amelungs yourselves,” cried Elsung,
“and must each give me your right hand and left foot as ransom.
If you refuse, I will have your heads as well, that I may avenge
my father, whom Samson slew.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes deigned no further answer. They paid another
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
toll than that demanded with the points of their swords and
spears, and with such hearty good will that Elsung’s men were
either slain, or else took to flight, and their lord himself was
finally overthrown and bound.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Hildebrand was about to tie the prisoner to a horse,
Elsung said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are Ermenrich’s men, so I will tell you the news that
has just reached me. The brothers of the Lady Swanhilde,
whom the emperor had trodden to death by horses, have fallen
upon him, and have cut off his hands and feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha!” cried the hero of Bern, “do you bring such good news?
Take your liberty in payment thereof.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The travellers now pursued their journey, and after meeting
with several more adventures, at last arrived safely at Garden,
where they were at first received with suspicion; but the Lady
Ute recognised her husband the moment she saw him, and
Hadubrand was introduced to his brave old father, whom he had
not seen since his childhood.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>To Bern.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The hero of Bern was welcomed with the utmost joy by his
people, and soon collected an army, which among its most
celebrated warriors numbered brave Lodwig and his son Konrad,
faithful Eckehart and his comrade Hache. Nor was Heime
wanting; he had done penance for his sins in a cloister, and
now, hearing of Dietrich’s return, hastened to him to renew his
oath, death having released him from the fealty he had formerly
owed to Ermenrich.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich’s and Sibich’s forces met. A terrible battle took
place. Dietrich fought with heroic valour, sweeping down all
before him. Eckehart and Hache sought untiringly for faithless
Sibich, and at last they recognised him among the fugitives,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
although he had cast from him all signs of the imperial
dignity he had usurped. Eckehart seized him by the scruff
of the neck, swung him before him on his horse, and galloped
back to the camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remember the Harlungs,” he cried, and immediately ordered
a gallows to be erected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sibich entreated for life, bare life. He offered much red gold
to have his death put off for even a short space, but—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remember the Harlungs,” was the only answer he received.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so the victory was won. The hero of Bern marched
to Romaburg at the head of his army. He was everywhere
met by the princes of the land of the Amelungs. They greeted
him as their chief, and on his arrival at Romaburg he received
the imperial crown.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Passing of Dietrich.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Herrat was a faithful wife and helpmeet. The old master
and many of his other ancient friends were round him; but in
the midst of his glory Dietrich could not forget the faithful
comrades who had died in his service, the friends who had given
him their all, and to whom he could no longer show either
love or kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>His power was great. The empire was more extensive than
it had ever been before, and peace reigned within its borders.
Once, indeed, a giant had committed great devastations within
the land, and Heime had sought him out, but only to be slain.
Dietrich himself had then gone forth, and had conquered the
monster. It was the last combat in which the aged hero ever
took part.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p>ROUND THEODERIC’S TOMB.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>His wife, noble Herrat, soon after fell sick and died. From
that time forward his character seemed changed. He was
gloomy and morose, and committed many actions for which no
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
after repentance could atone. The only one of his former
pleasures that gave him any happiness was that of hunting.
When he heard the cheerful sound of the horns, his face would
clear up, and a smile play on his lips, and he would once more
look like the Dietrich his friends had known of yore. Once,
when he was bathing in the river, a great stag with golden
horns, wonderful to look upon, trotted slowly along the bank,
and passed into the wood close by. He sprang out of the water,
threw on his clothes, and called for horse and hounds. Before
the servants could bring him what he desired, Dietrich perceived
a coal-black steed come towards him neighing. Seizing his
sword and darts, he hastily mounted the noble animal, and
galloped after the stag. His servants followed with the fleetest
horses in his stables, but could not come up with him. The
hero rode on faster, and ever faster. His people waited weeks,
months, and even years for his return, but all in vain. The
mighty empire had no ruler. Bloody wars broke out in consequence.
His subjects longed for his return, that his strong
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
hand might rule the land again; but still he did not come.
Wodan, his ancestor, had caught him up to himself, and had
made him one of his wild huntsmen. Many a benighted
traveller has seen him rushing past, mounted on his coal-black
steed. The people of Lausitz and other parts of Germany
talk of him as Dietherbernet, and see him in the Furious Host
even to this day.</p>

    <h3 id='p2c1s1'>I.<br />
    SIEGFRIED’S YOUTH.</h3>

<p class='dc10'>Once upon a time there
was a noble prince in
the Netherlands called Siegfried
(Sigfrît, Siegwart, or Sigurðr).
His father, Sigmund, was descended from the glorious
race of the Wölfungs, who traced their lineage back to Wodan.
His mother, Sigelinde, was of equally high birth. They both
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
rejoiced in the early signs of strength and activity displayed by
their son, and hoped that when grown to man’s estate, his heroic
deeds might gain him glory and renown.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy, however, soon became aware of his wonderful strength,
and showed a haughty, unbending spirit. He would suffer no
contradiction: he beat his playfellows black and blue when they
displeased him, even those among them who were much bigger
than he. The older he grew, the more he was hated by all the
other boys, and the more anxious his parents became regarding
his future.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last Sigmund told the queen that he only knew of one way
to bring the young rebel under rule, and that was to apprentice
him to the smith, Mimer, who lived in the neighbouring forest,
and who was a strong and wise man, and would teach the boy how
to forge the weapons he should one day wield as a warrior. The
queen gave her consent, so the father took the necessary steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the smith heard the whole story, he declared himself
ready to undertake the task assigned him, for he had a strong
belief in the pacifying effects of hard work. Everything went well
for a time. One year passed on after another, till the prince grew
almost to man’s estate. But labour in the smithy was irksome to
him, and when his comrades set him right, he beat them, threw
them down, and, on one occasion, went so far as to drag the best
smith among them—Wieland—by the hair to his master’s feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This will not do at all,” said Mimer; “come here and forge
yourself a good sword.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried was quite ready to do so. He asked for the best iron
and the heaviest hammer, which was such a weight that it took
both hands to wield it. Mimer drew the strongest bar of iron out
of the forge, glowing red, and laid it on the anvil. Siegfried
swung the hammer with one hand, as though it had been a plaything;
but when it came down upon the iron the blow was like
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
a clap of thunder, the house shook to its foundation, the iron
shivered into splinters, and the anvil sank a foot deep into the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This will never do,” said the master as before; “we must try
another plan, my boy, if you are to make yourself a suitable
weapon! Go to the charcoal-burner in the pine wood, and fetch
me as much of his charcoal as you can carry on your strong
shoulders. Meanwhile I shall prepare the best iron to make you
a sword, such as never yet was possessed by any warrior.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried was so pleased to hear this, that picking up the largest
axe he could find, he set out into the forest. It was a beautiful
spring day. The birds were singing, and the grass was studded
with violets and forget-me-nots. He plucked a bunch of the
flowers, and stuck them in his leather cap, from a half-conscious
feeling that they might perhaps bring him good luck. He went
on further and further, till he reached the middle of a dark pine
forest. Not a bird was to be seen; but the gloomy silence was
broken by a gurgling, hissing, and roaring, that might easily have
affrighted a less daring spirit. He soon found the reason of the
noise. A dismal swamp lay before him, in which gigantic toads,
snakes, and lind-worms were disporting themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never saw so many horrible creatures in my life,” said
Siegfried; “but I will soon stop their music.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, he picked up dead trees and threw them into the
morass, till he had completely covered it. After which, he
hastened on to the charcoal-burner’s house. Arrived there, he
asked the man to give him fire that he might burn the
monsters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor boy,” said the charcoal-burner, “I am very sorry for
you; but if you go back the way you came, the great dragon will
come out of his cave and make but a single mouthful of you.
Smith Mimer is a faithless man; he came here before you, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
told me that he had roused the worm against you, because you
were so unmanageable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have no fear, good man,” answered Siegfried; “I shall first
slay the worm, and then the smith. But now give me the fire,
that I may burn the poisonous brood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lad was soon back at the swamp. He set fire to the dry
wood with which he had covered it, and let it blaze. The wind
was favourable, and fanned the flames to a great fire, so that the
creatures were all burnt up in a short space of time. The lad then
went round the dismal swamp and found a small rivulet of hot fat
issuing from it. He dipped his finger in it, and found, on withdrawing
it, that it was covered with a horn-like skin. “Ah,” he
thought, “this would be useful in war.” He therefore undressed,
and bathed his whole body in the liquid fat, so that he was now
covered with horn from head to foot, except in one place, between
his shoulders, where a leaf had stuck to his skin. This he did not
discover until later. He dressed himself again in his leather
garments, and walked on, his club resting on his shoulder.
Suddenly the dragon darted out upon him from its hiding-place;
but three good blows of his club slew the monster. He then went
back to the smithy to take vengeance on the master smith and his
comrade. At sight of him, the men fled affrighted into the forest,
but the master awaited the youth’s arrival. At first Mimer tried
the effect of flattering words; but finding they were vain, he took
to his sword. Siegfried then dealt him one mighty blow, and had
no need to strike again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having done this, the lad went into the smithy, and with great
patience and care forged himself a sword, whose blade he hardened
in the blood of the lind-worm. Then he set out for his
father’s palace. The king sharply rebuked him for his evil deed
in slaying the master smith, who was so good a subject, and so
useful to the whole country. And the queen, in her turn, reproached
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
him with many tears, for having stained his hands with
innocent blood. Siegfried, sobered by his father’s reproof, and
softened by his mother’s tears, did not try to excuse himself; but,
falling at the queen’s feet and hiding his face in his hands, he
said the sight of her tears cut him to the heart, and for the future
he vowed that his deeds should be those of a gentle knight. Then
the hearts of the parents were comforted.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that time forward Siegfried was changed. He listened
to the advice of men of understanding, and strove to learn how
to act wisely and well. Whenever he felt one of his old fits of
passion coming over him, he thought of his mother’s tears and
his father’s reproof, and conquered the evil spirit that threatened
to master him. The expectations of the people were great respecting
him: they were sure that in him their nation had found
a new hero. And then, he was so handsome and graceful, that
the women admired him as much for his looks as the men did for
his prowess.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Young Siegfried sails to Isenland.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>His father and mother were so proud of him, that they longed
for the day when his name and fame should be hailed with
applause in every land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king at length deemed that the time was come to give
Siegfried and his comrades, and many young nobles of his own
and other lands, the sword and armour that marked a warrior.
This investiture was in those days a ceremony of great importance,
and took up the same place in a young man’s life as the
ceremony of knighthood in later times. The solemn investiture
was succeeded by feats of arms and trials of skill. Siegfried was
victorious in all, and, at the end of the day, the populace shouted:
“Long live young Siegfried, our king; long may he and his worthy
father rule over us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
But he signed to them, and said, “I am not worthy of such high
honour. I must first win a kingdom for myself. I will entreat
my noble father to allow me to go out into the world, and seek
my fortune.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the warriors were all assembled at the feast in the royal
hall, Siegfried did not take his place at the upper end of the
table beside his father, but modestly seated himself among the
young warriors who had still their names to make. Some of the
party began to talk of distant Isenland, the kingdom of the
beautiful and warlike Brunhild, who challenged all her wooers to
do battle with her, thereby slaying many.</p>

<p class='c007'>They talked of the land of the Nibelungs, learned in magic; of
the Drachenstein, where a flying dragon, of fiendish aspect, had
taken up its abode.</p>

<p class='c007'>Others, again, talked of the lovely princess at Worms on the
Rhine, who was carefully guarded by her three brothers and
by her uncle, strong Hagen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how pleasant it must be to see such marvels, and to
seek out adventures!” cried Siegfried, and approaching his father,
he asked his permission to go out and see the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king understood his desire, for he had had an adventurous
youth himself; and promised to let him go, provided his mother
gave her consent.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was pain and grief to the queen to part with her son, but
she at last permitted him to go, and one fine morning he set
out, dressed in a shining suit of armour, mounted on a swift
horse, and bearing the sword which he himself had made. His
spirits were high, and his heart full of hope, as is the case with
every youth of spirit who goes out into the unknown world to
seek his fortune.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went northwards in the direction of Isenland. On reaching
the sea-shore, he found a vessel ready to start; but the skipper
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
feared a storm, and only set sail at Siegfried’s entreaty. After
a quick but tempestuous voyage, Siegfried landed, and went up
to the palace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Brunhild received him in the great hall, where many
warriors were assembled, each of whom had come determined
to woo the lady by great feats of arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the following day the warriors assembled in the lists,
where Brunhild joined them before long. She was clad in full
armour, and looked as haughty and as beautiful as Freya, when
she led the Valkyrs of old to the battles of the heroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried gazed at her in astonishment. She was so much
taller and nobler looking than any of the maidens in her train,
who were armed equally with herself. He almost wished to join
the ranks of the wooers, and win her hand. He raised a stone
in sport, and flung it far beyond the lists; then, turning to the
queen, took leave of her with all reverence, and returned again
to his vessel, saying to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could never love her, she is too like a man. That maiden
must be shy and modest, gentle and kindly, who would gain
the heart of a brave warrior so utterly that he would think
nothing of spending his heart’s blood in her service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a quick voyage, he resumed his journey by land, now
through rich and well-cultivated plains, and again through desert
lands, where wild beasts and robbers had their abode. He had
many a hard fight by the way, and slew all manner of giants
and monsters. The minstrels sang of his great deeds in cottage
and in castle, so that his name became known far and wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he reached the land of the Nibelungs, the kings of that
country, Schilbung and Nibelung by name, asked him to divide
between them the treasure left them by their father Nibeling,
for they could not agree as to what was a fair division. In
payment for this service they offered him the good sword
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
Balmung, which was the handiwork of dwarfs, and was tempered
in dragon’s blood. The hero divided the treasure with the
utmost fairness, yet the brothers were not satisfied. They told
him that they were sure he was keeping back the most valuable
things for himself, and commanded twelve enormous giants to seize
him, and confine him in the hollow mountain where the treasure
was kept. The hero at once drew Balmung, and began slaying
one giant after another. Then the royal magicians chanted their
spells, and called up a thick mist; a storm arose, and the
mountain trembled under repeated thunder-claps. All in vain.
The last of the giants fell, and finally the two brothers were
slain; then the mist cleared away, and the sun shone full on
the victorious warrior.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Nibelung people saw the wonders that had been
done, they greeted Siegfried as their king. But even yet his
difficulties were not at an end. An avenger had arisen: this
was Alberich the dwarf. Well armed with enchanted weapons,
he came up against the bold warrior. He was now visible, now
invisible, according as he drew the cap of darkness over his helmet,
or took it off. After a long struggle, Siegfried overthrew him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwarf was now in his power, but Siegfried could not kill
a defenceless foe. Alberich was so touched with this generosity
that he swore to be true to his victor: an oath he never broke.
After this, no one disputed the hero’s right to the land of the
Nibelungs. He was recognised as king by the whole people,
and also became possessed of all the treasures in the hollow
mountain, and of Alberich’s cap of darkness by reason of his
victory over the dwarf.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Siegfried had reduced the whole kingdom to order, and
appointed proved men to be governors of the provinces, he
chose out twelve noble warriors to be his trusty companions.
The treasure furnished him with rings and chains of silver and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
gold with which to enrich his followers. The whole band
looked like an assemblage of kings under the lead of some
yet mightier chieftain.</p>

<p class='c007'>He and his men now set out on their journey homewards,
and reached the Netherlands without further adventure. The
king and queen were overjoyed to see their son, of whom they
had for a long time heard nothing but indistinct rumours.
Siegfried remained at home for many days to rest and recover
from his weariness. He often passed hours sitting at his mother’s
feet, as when he was a little boy, and telling her of his hopes
and longings. His confidence and trust in her made her very
happy. But when he stood before her in all the panoply of war,
her heart beat high with pride that she had such a hero for a son.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pleasant as it was to be at home again, Siegfried could not
long be contented with idleness; his soul panted to be out in
the battle of life, where alone a man preserves his strength of
mind and body. He told his father that he wished to go to
Worms, in the Rhineland, and try his fortune with the great
warriors of Burgundy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king’s face clouded when he heard this. “My son,” he
said, “do not go to Burgundy, for there dwell the boldest
warriors in the whole world. No hero has as yet withstood
them. There are grim Hagen, strong Ortewin of Metz, and
King Gunther, with his brother Gernot. They all unite in
guarding the lovely maiden Chriemhild, whom many a brave
man has wooed, only to lose his life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! That is a good story!” cried bold Siegfried. “These
mighty warriors shall yield me their kingdom, and the lovely
maid as well, if she be pleasing in my eyes. With my twelve
Nibelungs at my back, I have no fears about the fighting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king’s remonstrances and the queen’s entreaties were alike
in vain. They were obliged to consent to their son’s undertaking
this adventure.</p>

<h3 id='p2c1s2' class='c020'>II. SIEGFRIED IN BURGUNDY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >The lovely maiden Chriemhild, who lived in the land of
Burgundy, was the daughter of King Dankrat and his wife,
the Lady Ute. Her father had long been dead; but his three
sons, Gunther, Gernot, and the boy Giselherr, nicknamed “The
Child,” regarded their beautiful sister as the costliest pearl in their
crown. The royal brothers were surrounded by brave warriors,
to whom fear was unknown. First among these was grim Hagen
of Tronje, un-beautiful of face, and one-eyed, but known and
feared, both in the land of the Teuts and in that of the Latins.
He enjoyed great honour for another reason, that he was the uncle
of the kings. After him came his brother, the marshal Dankwart;
Ortewin of Metz; the Margraves Gere and Eckewart;
Rumolt, the chief cook; Volker of Alzeyen, the faithful minstrel;
Sindolt, the cup-bearer; and Hunolt, the steward. These and
many other brave men, too numerous to mention, served the kings,
and guarded their interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Chriemhild lived very much alone. She loved to wander
about the garden and under the shady trees, and hated all sights
and sounds of war. Her brothers once persuaded her to go out
hunting with them; but a roe-deer fell dead at her horse’s feet,
and the sight so distressed her, that she went straight home, and
could never be induced to go out hunting again.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
One day the queen entered her daughter’s room at an early
hour, and seeing her look sad and troubled, she asked what ailed
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild answered: “I dreamed that I had brought up a
noble falcon, and had grown very fond of it; but once, when I
let it fly up among the cliffs, two eagles attacked and killed it
before my very eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My child,” said the mother gravely, “the falcon is some noble
warrior, whom you will learn to love with all your heart; and
the eagles are two false men, who will seek to compass his death
by cunning. May God give you strength and wisdom to turn
their plans to nought!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother!” said Chriemhild, “do not speak to me of men. I
fear to go amongst them. If there were no men on the earth,
there would be no more wars or bloodshed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who knows?” answered her mother, laughing. “Women often
shed more blood, and cut deeper with their tongues, than any man
with his sword. But the time will come when you will learn to
love some hero, and will become his wife and chief admirer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never,” cried the maiden in a voice of horror. “Mother,
you terrify me even more than my dream.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ute and Chriemhild went down to the garden. They had not
been there long when they heard the sound of horses prancing
in the court, and horns blowing. The queen went to see what
was going on, and soon came back to tell her daughter of the
arrival of some strange warriors in shining armour, and mounted
on beautiful horses. She asked the girl to come and help her
to receive the guests. But Chriemhild refused to do so, and
Ute returned to the palace alone. Meanwhile Gunther and his
brothers had heard of the coming of the strangers. No one knew
who they were, so Hagen was sent for, and he at once recognised
Siegfried. He further advised his nephew to receive the hero
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
and his men with all honour, and to enter into friendly alliance
with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gunther resolved to follow Hagen’s counsel; but Siegfried said
that he had come to prove to his own satisfaction whether the
Burgundian warriors were as great in battle as he had always
heard. He offered them the Nibelung realm and treasure as the
prize of victory, and said that for his own part he was ready to
defend himself against double or threefold the number of his own
party, if the kings of Burgundy would venture their kingdom
against his. Bold Ortewin and other Burgundian heroes answered
that it was not their habit to fight strange warriors for aught else
than their armour and horses. And King Gernot came forward
and said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord Siegfried, we want neither your goods nor your blood;
I rather desire to receive you as an honoured guest, and become
your friend and ally, if you will also be ours.” So saying, he
held out his hand, which Siegfried clasped in his, as he replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“God be my witness that I will be your faithful friend and
ally, and if you ever come to see me, I shall greet you as honoured
comrades.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nibelungs then followed their hosts into the banqueting
hall, where many a toast was drunk to the success of the new
alliance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried enjoyed his stay in the land of roses and vineyards.
The days passed happily in hunting or jousting; but a great
longing to see fair Chriemhild soon took possession of him, and
grew stronger every day, for he was always hearing of her
sweetness, modesty, and gentleness—qualities that had ever pleased
him best in women.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild had also heard of him; but the only time she had
ever seen him was once when curiosity led her to peep out of
a high window, when he was jousting in the court below. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
seemed to her like the white god Balder, of whose beauty and
glory her forefathers had told many a tale. At that very moment,
he looked up, and she shrank away, fearing lest he had seen her;
but he had not. Chriemhild could not understand herself. She
hoped that he would stay at Worms—she, who had never before
cared who came or went.</p>

<p class='c007'>An embassy from Daneland and Saxonland arrived at Worms.
The kings Lüdegast and Lüdeger declared war against Burgundy,
if the kings of Burgundy did not at once pay them tribute, as
in olden times.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tribute was refused, and the Burgundian army was called
out. Siegfried and his men joined King Gunther’s forces. The
armies met. The Danes and Saxons numbered forty thousand;
the Burgundian forces were much fewer. Each side fought
bravely, but Siegfried’s performances were perhaps more wonderful
than any other man’s. He took King Lüdegast prisoner, and
brought him sorely wounded into camp; handed him over to
the care of servants, and returned to the battle. The fight raged
on for hours. Grim Hagen was always in the front rank, and
near him were Volker, Sindolt, and Hunolt. Siegfried fought
by their side, always keeping the king of Saxony in sight. At
length he reached Lüdeger, and swung his sword over his head.
Then the Saxon king exclaimed,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha, Siegfried of the Netherlands, the devil has given me into
your hands. I acknowledge myself your prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle was at an end, and the victors, covered with glory
and laden with booty, set out on their return to the Rhine. They
were received at Worms with great joy, and Siegfried’s name was
in every mouth. King Gunther prepared a feast of victory, which
was to take place some weeks later, so that the wounded warriors
might be well enough to take part in it. Lüdeger and Lüdegast
offered a large ransom for their liberty. While the Burgundians
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
were debating what sum it would be proper to demand, Siegfried
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“A king’s head is neither to be bought nor ransomed for gold,
silver, or precious stones. It can only be won in love through
well-doing. Let the imprisoned kings go free, provided they
promise Burgundy their help in war.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the days of feasting were over, the guests all took their
leave, and the Nibelung hero was about to do the same. But
Gunther, acting on Ortewin’s advice, begged him to tarry a little
longer, for the women, and more especially his sister, Chriemhild,
wished to show him their gratitude. The hero’s face lighted up
with pleasure, while he answered that in that case he would stay.
When the king went to the women to tell them what he wished
them to do, he felt at the bottom of his heart a little fear lest his
sister should refuse; but, though she blushed, she consented to
do his will.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time appointed, she entered the hall at Lady Ute’s side;
and as she entered, her eyes and Siegfried’s met. She said a
few words to him with her usual gentle courtesy, and his heart
beat with a feeling he had never known before. No one in the
crowd noticed the look that had passed between them except
Queen Ute, who rejoiced to see it, for she loved them both. She
contrived that the hero should sit next to her daughter at the
feast, and that he should afterwards join them in the garden,
while the other warriors sat over their wine.</p>

<h3 id='p2c1s3' class='c020'>III. THE DRAGONSTONE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Siegfried returned to his lodging that evening feeling
happier than he had ever done before. Early next morning,
he rode out into the wood to hunt; but his thoughts were so full
of Chriemhild, that he let the game pass by unheeded. Coming
back empty-handed in the afternoon, he found both town and
palace in great confusion. Warriors and citizens were shouting
and crowding in every open place. Queen Ute was weeping and
wringing her hands. Siegfried heard broken fragments of conversation;
but no one answered his questions. At length he entered
the great hall, where he found Hagen, and asked him the meaning
of the disturbance, and whether some dreadful thing had
happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That it has,” replied Hagen; “it could not be worse; but what
is to be, must be, and, as men said in the olden time, ‘what the
Norns have ordained must needs be best.’ Hearken, Siegfried.
When we were in the tilt-yard this morning, we were startled by
hearing a rushing noise in the air, and the brightness of the sun
was darkened as if the wolf Skiöll were devouring it. The
thing of terror that approached was a flying-dragon, of shape so
monstrous, that there is none like it in all the realm of Helle.
As it flew over our heads, we flung spears at it, but they bounced
off its horny skin like reeds. Next moment we heard a cry, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
saw that the monster had caught up sweet Chriemhild from her
seat in the garden, and was bearing her off through the air so
rapidly that both were soon out of sight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And none of you went in pursuit!” shouted the Nibelung
hero, “cowards that you are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you mad?” asked Hagen, unmoved. “Are you a bird,
that you can fly through wind and cloud?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall seek out the monster,” said Siegfried quietly; “if I
have to wander through the whole world and Helle’s realm itself,
I shall find the maiden, or—my death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hastened away, mounted his horse, and rode by unknown
paths, leading he knew not whither. A ferryman set him across
the Rhine, and then he wandered about among the bare mountains,
but found no trace of the dragon’s abode. At length he
reached a dark and trackless pine forest. The boughs of the trees
hung so low that he had to dismount, and lead his horse by the
bridle. As night came on, he threw himself under a tree, utterly
exhausted, leaving his steed to graze at will.</p>

<p class='c007'>At midnight he heard the tramp of a horse’s hoofs, and, looking
up, saw a faint red light approaching. The rider was a little
dwarf. On his head was a golden crown, the point of which was
formed of a shining carbuncle. The hero asked the dwarf to show
him the way out of the forest, and the little creature answered
that he was glad they had met, for no one knew the forest better
than he; adding, that he was the dwarf-king Eugel, who lived
in the mountains hard by with his brothers, and thousands more
of their race.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As for you,” he continued, “I know that you are Siegfried
of the Netherlands. I have often seen you when I have been
going about the world with my cap of darkness on. You could
never have got out of the wild wood without my help, but would
infallibly have found your grave at the Drachenstein, where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span>
terrible giant Kuperan and the great dragon have taken up their
abode.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On hearing this, Siegfried shouted aloud for joy, and promised
the dwarf a rich reward, even to the whole Nibelung hoard, if he
would lead him to the Drachenstein. This Eugel refused to do,
fearing for the hero’s life; but when Siegfried threatened to slay
him, and at the same time seized him by the waist and shook him
till his crown fell off, he promised to obey. He replaced his
crown, and rode on first through the dark forest. At daybreak
they reached their destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Knock at that door,” said the little king. “It is there that
Kuperan lives. If you are hero enough to slay the giant, I and
mine will serve you, for now we are entirely in the power of that
monster.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus spoken, he donned his cap of darkness, and
vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried knocked at the door, at first gently, then louder and
louder, at the same time shouting to Kuperan to give him the
keys of the Drachenstein. Suddenly the door sprang open, the
giant rushed out in a tremendous passion, and asked in a thunderous
voice what Siegfried meant by disturbing his morning’s
sleep. With these words he hit out at the warrior with the pole
he had in his hands, which was taller than any of the tree tops,
and every blow of which rang like a castle bell. Siegfried sprang
aside to avoid the pole, and then the battle began. The giant
swung his pole with such good will that trees and rocks came
rattling down, but he never succeeded in touching his agile foe. At
length, holding his weapon in both hands, he brought it down on
the ground with such terrible force that it clove the earth three
fathoms deep. As he stooped to draw it out, the hero sprang
upon him and gave him three deep wounds. The giant, howling
with pain, slunk into his dwelling, and slammed the door behind
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
him. Siegfried battered at the iron door, but could not move it.
He sought to force an opening with his good sword, and succeeded
in cutting some holes and crannies. He peeped into the inner
room, and saw the giant binding up his wounds, and then arming
himself in a suit of mail, that glistened like the sun when mirrored
in the sea. In another minute Kuperan came forth, and the
combat was renewed. After a long struggle, Siegfried had the
best of it, and the giant begged for his life, swearing to be a
true comrade and helper in the hero’s fight with the dragon, who
could not be overcome without his aid. Upon this Siegfried gave
Kuperan his hand in friendship, bound up his wounds, and promised
on his side to be his faithful comrade; but as he entered
the cavern first, the false giant hit him so hard a blow on his
helmet that he fell senseless to the ground. Eugel, who was
watching all that passed, unseen, came up at the same moment
and flung his cap of darkness over the hero. While the monster
thought he had vanished through enchantment, and felt about
for him outside, Siegfried recovered from his swoon, sprang to
his feet, and tearing off the cap of darkness, cut down the giant
with the first blow. He once more forgave the traitor, but forced
him to go on before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Faithless Kuperan again tried to murder the hero at the
entrance of the Drachenstein, and Siegfried would not have again
forgiven him if he had not needed his help to save the maiden.
The giant now brought out the key, unlocked the door, and led
the hero through many passages into a vaulted chamber, in which
a soft twilight reigned. Looking round, Siegfried saw her whom
he sought, looking pale and wan, but very beautiful. He called
her name, and hastened to her. He even dared to clasp her in
his arms; he felt that she returned his kiss, and the consciousness
that he was loved made him feel so strong that he could have
fought all the powers of hell for her sweet sake. Chriemhild
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
wept bitterly, and entreated him to be gone before the dragon
came back; but Siegfried asked for nothing better than to come
face to face with the monster, hew him in pieces, and save the
princess. The giant now told them that a sword was hidden
in the Drachenstein, so fashioned that it could cut through the
scales of a dragon. The warrior set out to fetch it, accompanied
by Kuperan and Chriemhild. Siegfried saw the hilt of a sword
on a ledge of rock just below the edge of the beetling cliff. He
stooped to pick it up, and at the same moment the monster
seized him, and strove to fling him over. A terrible struggle
began, in which the bandages came off the giant’s wounds, his
blood streamed down, his strength failed him, and Siegfried flung
him into the depths below. A loud laugh of joy was heard, and
the victor, turning, saw King Eugel, who thanked him heartily
for having delivered the dwarfs from their cruel task-master. At
his command a number of mannikins appeared, bearing food and
wine to refresh the brave warrior after his exertions. He was
much in need of food, for he had not tasted a mouthful for two
days. The dishes Chriemhild placed before him, and the wine
she gave him, tasted better than anything he had ever eaten or
drunk before.</p>

<p class='c007'>All at once a rushing sound was heard in the air, and a howl
of rage, so terrible, that all the dwarfs hid themselves in any
crannies of the rock that they could find, and the hero and
maiden were startled out of their momentary feeling of security.
Chriemhild entreated, prayed her lover to conceal himself; but
he was a stranger to fear, and refused to fly. The monster
approached like a storm-cloud, preceded by flames of fire. It
came nearer and nearer, dark, mysterious, gruesome. The
mountain trembled, and the little dwarfs, hiding in the fissures
of the rock, feared to be crushed to death. At Siegfried’s
request, Chriemhild withdrew into the vaulted chamber. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
now the dragon fell upon the hero, tore away his shield with its
claws, and tried to seize him in its great teeth. The warrior
knew how to act; he sprang aside, until the fiery breath that
issued from the dragon’s yawning jaws had cooled. Then he
renewed his attack, now on the right, now on the left of the
monster, taking care to avoid its claws.</p>

<p class='c007'>All at once he felt himself encircled by the dragon’s tail.
He made a marvellous spring, freed himself, and sought to
attack the creature in front, where it was undefended by scales.
Upon this, the dragon caught him so tight within its curling
tail that he could not free himself. In sore distress, he seized
his good sword Balmung in both hands, and gave so hard a
blow that the rocks trembled; but his object was attained.
The tail was cut off, and rolled thundering over the edge of
the cliff. A second blow, as hard as the first, divided the
monster in two. ’Tis true, the jaws still snapped at the hero,
but he, with the last effort of his strength, flung the pieces over
the cliff. Having done this, he fell back exhausted and half
stifled by the poisonous breath with which the dragon had so
long surrounded him. When he came to himself he found
Chriemhild’s arms round him, and the dwarfs busily engaged
burning herbs and sprinkling essences to do away with the
baneful effect of the fetid odours with which the place was
impregnated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwarfs now led the hero and the maiden into their
underground kingdom, where a feast was prepared for them.
While they rested, Eugel told them that the dragon had formerly
been a man of handsome figure and face, but that a mighty
enchantress, whom he had deserted, changed him into a dragon,
under which form he was to remain for the rest of his life,
unless a pure maiden should consent to marry him within six
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
The dwarfs offered the warrior his choice of all their treasures.
He took certain things from them, placed them on his horse
beside Chriemhild, and, accompanied by Eugel, set out on his
return to Worms. When they reached the edge of the wild
forest, the dwarf-king looked at him sadly, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must know, bold warrior, that your life will be short,
but glorious. You will fall by the envy of your own kindred.
But your fame will last through all ages, and your name
will be held in honour by the bards of every nation as long as
the human race exists on the earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Eugel then took leave of him, and returned to his home in
the forest. When Siegfried and Chriemhild came down to the
banks of the Rhine, the hero took the treasure that the dwarf
had given him, and sunk it in the deep waters of the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the use of gold to me?” he said. “My life is to
be short, but glorious! Hide it in thy bosom, mighty river;
may it gild thy waves and make them gleam more brightly in
the sunlight! Gold does the devil’s work in the hands of the
children of men; it sharpens the assassin’s dagger to strike
some unsuspecting heart—perhaps mine. But as yet I live in
the light of day. I will rejoice in my glory, and in my love
for the sweetest maiden on the face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then rejoined Chriemhild, and called the ferryman to take
them across the Rhine, after which they pursued their way to
Worms, and were received there with great rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried took the first opportunity when he found Gunther
alone to ask him for his sister’s hand, and the king answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will give her to you with all my heart, if you will first
help me to win a high-born and most heroic woman to be my
wife. I mean Brunhild, the proud queen of Isenland, for whose
sweet sake many a wooer has already gone to his death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know her well,” replied Siegfried, “and have seen how
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
she bears herself in the fray. She fights bravely and well,
yet I do not fear but that she will find her masters in you
and me. You will do well to prepare for an early start, that
we may get back before the end of summer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Ute and her daughter feared the result of the adventure,
but Siegfried told them to be of good courage. He
promised to stand by Gunther in life and death,—even the proud
queen of Isenland would scarcely prove so hard an antagonist
as the monster of the Drachenstein. The king proposed to
take a thousand warriors in his train, but Siegfried dissuaded
him; and when at last they started, the party of adventurers
consisted of Gunther, grim Hagen, Dankwart, and himself.</p>

<h3 id='p2c1s4' class='c020'>IV. THE WOOING OF BRUNHILD</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >After a favourable voyage they arrived at Isenstein, and
rode up to the palace. Servants hastened to meet them
and take their armour and horses. Hagen was at first unwilling
to give up his horse and armour, but he yielded when
Siegfried told him that such was the law and custom at Isenstein.
The warriors entered the hall where Brunhild awaited them, clad
in her royal robes. She greeted her guests with courtesy, and
told the Nibelung hero how glad she was to see him again, as
she had been told of his great deeds of valour; adding that
she supposed he had come to enter the lists. Siegfried then
informed her that he had only come as the comrade of King
Gunther, his lord, who desired to try his fortune, and who was
well worthy of the high prize of victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is news to me!” said the queen, “I always thought
you were your own man, and owed no allegiance to another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, turning to King Gunther, she told him that she had
also heard of his great deeds, and asked him who were the
warriors that bore him company. Gunther answered with many
thanks for her kind reception, and explained who and what
his companions were. Brunhild laughed, and asked whether he
intended to fight aided by his three comrades.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I alone am to fight,” answered the king; “I alone compete
for the great prize.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
“Very well,” said the lady, “the lists are open, prepare to do
your best.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The warriors were led into the castle court, where a wide space
was enclosed for the combat. The queen’s serving-men surrounded
it, well armed. One of these proclaimed in a loud
voice:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If any nobly-born warrior ventures to play the three-fold play
with the queen, and gains the victory, she and her kingdom shall
be his; but if he is conquered, his head and wealth belong to
her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Four grooms now dragged a great stone into the lists, which
the combatants were to “put” (throw). It was as large and heavy
as a millstone. Three other men brought in the huge broadsword
which the maiden was accustomed to fling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the woman can play with such a thing as that,” said Hagen,
“she is the devil’s bride. No son of man can win her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we only had our weapons,” cried Dankwart, “neither the
king nor we need lose our lives.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be of good courage, King Gunther,” said Siegfried, “I will fetch
my cap of darkness from the ship, and will help you without any
one seeing that I do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hastened away whilst all eyes were fixed upon the queen,
who now entered the court, surrounded by her ladies, and clad
in full armour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it right, noble queen,” said Hagen, “that your men should
be armed, while we remain defenceless?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring the warriors their armour,” commanded Brunhild. Then
turning to Hagen, she continued: “But, for all that, you must
lose your lives here. If I conquer Gunther, as I have hitherto
conquered all who have entered the lists with me, your heads will
fall under the axe of yonder man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes looked in the direction in which she pointed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
perceived a man clad in blood-red garments standing without the
barrier holding a sharp axe in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trial of strength began.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brunhild went up to the stone, lifted it in both hands, and flung
it the length of six fathoms. After which, she leapt forward with
one spring as light as a bird, making the point of her foot touch
the stone. This feat was greeted with applause. Then came a
silence as of death. Gunther advanced. Aided by Siegfried’s
strength, he lifted the stone, weighed it in one hand, and flung it
a full fathom farther than the queen. It was a stronger hand than
his that helped him both in this and in the leap that followed,
which carried him beyond the stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first feat of strength, he was thus indisputably the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Brunhild rose with flashing eyes, and seized the heavy
spear with its sharp steel point.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now look to yourself, proud king,” she cried, and flung the
weapon with such force that it crashed through his shield, and
would have laid him prostrate had not Siegfried come to his aid
by turning the point towards the edge of the shield instead of the
centre. Then tearing it out of the broken shield, he turned the
weapon so that the blunt end pointed at the queen, and guiding
Gunther’s hand, Siegfried launched it at her. And immediately
Brunhild fell backwards, her chain armour rattling with the force
of her fall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The combat was at an end, the victory won. Brunhild rose.
She stood calmly before the people, accepting her fate; but whoever
could have read her heart would have seen it full of shame,
anger, and a wild thirst for vengeance. The notables of Isenland
were summoned to appear at Isenstein within three days to take
the oath of allegiance to Gunther. Brunhild begged the Burgundian
warriors to remain her guests during that time. She asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
where the Nibelung hero was, and when he stepped forward, and
said that he had been busied about the ship and the sailors, she
called him a faithless servant for not having been by while his
master played so dangerous a game.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great feast was made in the hall. Many ladies were present,
but the queen remained in her own apartments. Gunther’s feelings
were very mixed. He was ashamed not to have won the
victory single-handed, and yet he was pleased at having gained
his object. Hagen drained many a cup of wine, and watched the
laughing warriors around with a grim look on his stern face.
When the heroes of the Rhine were taken to their common chamber,
Hagen advised them to see that their weapons were at hand,
because he feared the queen was nursing some treacherous plan
against them. Bold Siegfried answered that he would at once
set out for the land of the Nibelungs, and return with an army
of good men and true. He made his way to the ship unperceived
in the darkness, and set sail for his own kingdom. Arrived there,
he went straight to the dwarf Alberich who guarded the treasure,
and desired him to call out a thousand well-armed men to go
with him to Isenland. His commands were obeyed in an incredibly
short time, and he and his troops set out to join his
friends. On the third morning, he landed in front of the palace,
to the great joy of the Burgundians. The queen, on the other
hand, was anxious, not knowing what the arrival of so large a
force might mean. But Gunther comforted her by explaining that
Siegfried had brought over a band of his Nibelungs to do honour
to him, the king.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the next few days everything was arranged for the
proper government of Isenland, and when Brunhild at length took
leave of her people and her mother’s brother, who had been
appointed governor, there was hardly a dry eye to be seen. The
queen herself was not happy, for she felt sure she would never
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
see her home again; but Gunther would not let her lose time,
being anxious to get back to Worms to celebrate his marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the travellers arrived in Burgundy, they were received
with great joy by every one. The Lady Ute welcomed Brunhild
as a daughter, and Chriemhild kissed her, and promised to be a
faithful sister to her. So the two maidens stood side by side: the
one, grand, beautiful, and mysterious as a starlight night; the
other, sweet, gentle, and lovely as a May morning. None looking
at them could say which was the fairest. But Siegfried had no
doubt. He never moved from Chriemhild’s side till they reached
the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>That evening, Gunther asked Siegfried and Chriemhild if they
were still of the same mind as before, and, finding that they
were, announced that he would make preparations for a double
wedding on the following day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brunhild sat at the feast that evening by Gunther’s side, pale
and cold as marble, while Chriemhild sat smiling and whispering
between her mother and her lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“King of Burgundy,” said Brunhild, at last, “I cannot understand
why you give your sister in marriage to one of your
vassals. She ought to be the wife of a great king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say not so,” answered Gunther; “Siegfried is as much a
king as I am. He is king of the Nibelungs, and, after the
death of his father Sigmund, the whole Netherlands will belong
to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a strange story,” she said; “he told me himself that
he was your man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will explain it all to you another time,” replied Gunther;
“we’ll say no more about it just now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The double wedding took place next day. When the ceremony
was over, the old queen showed her daughter-in-law all
her possessions, and gave up to her all authority in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
“Ah, mother Ute,” said the young wife, “the Burgundians
are rich in wealth and great in power; but they are poor in
wisdom and weak in action, otherwise King Gunther never
would have come to Isenland.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without waiting for an answer, she turned and left the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The feast was at an end, twilight had long fallen, and the
guests all sought their beds. Gunther and his queen went to
their private apartments. When he would have followed her
into her room, she barred the way, saying,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is no place for you; you can find a more fitting room
elsewhere in the palace. If I permitted you to enter, I should
lose my great strength.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At first he tried entreaties, then threats, and lastly force. They
wrestled together, but she very soon mastered him, bound him
hand and foot, and left him lying outside the door. He did
not sleep much that night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning, before the household was stirring, the proud
queen loosed her husband’s bonds, desired him to hold his peace,
and to respect her will in future. Gunther was sad at heart
the whole day long; he looked at his wife with a feeling that
was almost horror, and often left the feast to walk alone in
the garden. Siegfried met him there, and asked what ailed
him. When he heard the strange story, he cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be comforted, dear comrade; we have conquered this proud
woman before, and I think we shall get the better of her again.
I will follow you to-night, hidden under my cap of darkness,
when you take the queen to her room. Blow out the candles
and let me take your place. Then she shall have an opportunity
of trying her great strength against me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, good comrade,” said Gunther, “I fear for your life. We
did ill to bring her from Isenland to the sunny banks of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
Rhine. She is a demon, as Hagen says, and has her marvellous
strength from her friends the devils.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Siegfried, “and even if a demon has taken up
his abode in her heart, it shall go hard but we’ll get the better
of him. I shall be with you to-night in my cap of darkness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The kings returned to the feast, Siegfried looking as cheerful
as ever, while Gunther was bowed down by manifold cares and
anxieties. At midnight Gunther led Brunhild to her room,
blew out the candles, and immediately Siegfried took his place.
The wrestling began, Brunhild pushed him between the wall
and a cupboard, and tried to bind him with her girdle. She
squeezed his hands till the blood spirted from under his nails.
Such a wrestling-match was never seen between a man and
a maid. He used all his hero-might, and pressed her into a
corner of the room with such force, that, shivering and moaning,
she entreated him not to kill her, and she would be an obedient
wife. No sooner did Siegfried hear this than he slipped softly
away, leaving Gunther alone with the queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wedding festivities lasted eight days longer; then the
guests took leave of their host, and went home with many
rich gifts. Siegfried and his wife also made ready for their
departure. The hero refused to take any dowry with his wife,
for, in his opinion, the Nibelung treasure was wealth enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was on a beautiful day that the travellers reached the
Netherlands. King Sigmund and Queen Sigelinde came out to
meet them, and received them with great joy. An assembly of
the people was summoned to meet, and after a short speech
from the throne, the old king and queen placed their crowns on
the heads of Siegfried and Chriemhild. The people shouted,
“Long live our young king and queen! May they reign as
long and as happily as their forerunners!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed as if the people’s wish were to be realized, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
years passed on, and all went well with the royal family. Queen
Sigelinde had the great joy of holding a grandson in her arms.
The child received the name of Gunther, in honour of his uncle
in the distant Rhineland. And King Gunther, who had a son
born about the same time, called the infant Siegfried. Not long
after this the old queen was taken ill and died. This made
a break in their domestic happiness; but still there was peace
in the realm, and along its borders.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Eight years, or thereabouts, had come and gone, when
messengers arrived from Burgundy inviting Siegfried
and Chriemhild to a great feast. They accepted the invitation,
and Sigmund determined to accompany them to Worms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brunhild had said one day to her husband, “King Gunther,
why does your brother-in-law Siegfried never come to our
court like the other vassals? I should like to see both him
and your sister Chriemhild. Pray send, and command their
presence at court.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told you before,” answered Gunther, somewhat nettled,
“that my brother-in-law is as mighty a king as I. He rules
over the Nibelungs and the Netherlands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How strange!” she replied. “You cannot deny that he
called himself your man when he was in Isenland.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! he only said that to help me in my wooing,” said
Gunther, feeling uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You only say that,” was her answer, “to make your sister
seem to have a higher rank. But however that may be, I should
very much like to see them both at our court.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” he answered kindly, “I will send messengers to
invite them to the Midsummer feast, and they will not refuse
to come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
He went away, and did as he had said. Brunhild remained
alone, plunged in thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he goes,” she muttered. “The man that conquered the
once heroic maiden, who thought herself strong enough to brave
the battle like the Valkyrs of old. And he, what is he but a weak
reed, moved hither and thither by every breath of wind that
blows? How much greater Siegfried is! He is a hero with the
world at his feet. But then a vassal! To be sure, none such
could dare to raise his eyes to the queen of Isenland. Had he
done so, she must have scorned him, and would scorn him to this
very hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Siegfried and his party came to Worms at the appointed time.
There was no end to the feasting, tilting, and minstrelsy. Old Sigmund
renewed his youth again, and delighted to talk of old days
with the Lady Ute, whom he had known as a child. The young
queens were always together, at church, or at the feast, or else in
the gallery overlooking the tilt-yard. The only amusement to
which Chriemhild did not accompany her sister-in-law was the
chase.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day when they were sitting together in the gallery watching
the feats of agility and skill shown by the warriors, she said in
the joy of her heart:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not my Siegfried glorious among warriors, like a moon
among the pale stars of night? He is a royal hero.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is well deserving of your praise,” replied Brunhild, “but
still he must yield the first place to my husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of a truth,” answered Chriemhild, “my brother is a bold
warrior, but he does not equal my husband in feats of arms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why,” said Brunhild, “did not win he the prize at Isenstein,
while Siegfried remained with the ship?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean to accuse the Nibelung hero, the dragon-queller,
of cowardice?” cried the young wife indignantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
“He cannot stand so high as the king of Burgundy,” answered
Brunhild, “for he is not his own man, but owes fealty to my
husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You lie, proud woman!” exclaimed Chriemhild, her face flushing
with anger, “you lie most insolently. My brother would
never have let me marry a man who was not free. Siegfried owes
no man allegiance, neither for Nibelungland nor yet for Netherland.
The first kingdom he conquered with his own right hand,
the other is his inheritance; and I, his queen, may hold my head
as high as you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Try it, chatterer! I shall always walk into church before
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words Brunhild left the gallery. Chriemhild felt
both hurt and angry. It was the first grief that had ever befallen
her, and she could not get over it. She went to her rooms, put on
her costliest garments and the jewels that had come out of the
Nibelung treasure; then, followed by her ladies and serving-men,
she walked to the minster. Brunhild was already there with her
train. She would have passed the proud woman silently, but the
latter exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your husband is my husband’s man, so wait here, and let your
queen go first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better for you had you held your peace,” said Chriemhild.
“A paramour go before a king’s wife, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you mad?” asked Brunhild. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you what I mean,” replied Chriemhild, “when I
come out of church;” and passing before her enemy, she went in
to the house of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proud queen stood still, weeping, at the entrance door.
Shame and anger struggled in her breast, and she could scarcely
wait till the end of the service. At length the door opened, and
Chriemhild appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
“Now,” exclaimed Brunhild, “stop, and explain what you
meant by your insulting words, you wife of a bondsman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wife of a bondsman?” repeated Chriemhild, as though she
had not heard the other words. “Do you recognise the gold ring
on my hand shaped like a serpent?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is mine,” said Brunhild. “Now I know who stole it
from me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” continued Chriemhild, “maybe you also remember the
silken girdle I wear round my waist, with its gold buckles and
precious stones. My husband gained both the ring and the girdle
that night, when he, not Gunther, conquered you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild went her way with the air of a hero on the day
of his greatest victory. The proud queen remained standing
where her sister-in-law had left her, her head bowed with shame.
She sent for her husband, and when he came, told him how she
had been insulted. And Gunther promised to ask Siegfried if
he had any knowledge of what had taken place. He received
his brother-in-law in the royal hall, and in the presence of many
of his bravest warriors. He told him what had chanced, and
immediately the Nibelung hero declared, in all good truth, that
he had never spoken of dishonour and of the queen in the same
breath; adding that too much weight should not be laid on the
words that women spoke in anger. He then offered to clear
himself by a solemn oath. But Gunther interrupted him, saying
he knew him of old, and that his word was as good as his bond.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hearken, then, ye men of Burgundy,” said the hero; “you
see that I am pronounced innocent of causing the humiliations
your queen has endured, and indeed I have always regarded her
as a modest woman, and a good wife. And now, dear comrade
Gunther, chide your wife as I shall chide mine for what they
have this day done, that we may never again be brought to
dispeace by their idle chatter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
He then turned and left the hall; but many a Burgundian
felt that their queen had suffered a cruel wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day Brunhild began to make preparations for her departure
to Isenland. The king and his brothers entreated her
to stay; but she sat silent and immovable as a stone figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We cannot let you go,” cried the king. “We will at any
cost expiate my sister’s thoughtless speech. What price do you
demand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She rose, looked round the circle of warriors, and said in a
hoarse and hollow voice:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blood!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Burgundians started, and stared at each other, none
daring to speak. She continued in the same tone:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not all the waters of the Rhine could wash the stain from
my honour. The heart’s blood of yonder man alone can do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The uneasiness of the warriors increased; but Hagen said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are the bold Burgundians grown weak with age? Have
they become children again? I will explain the matter. Our
queen demands the heart’s-blood of Siegfried. Ha! The words
seem to terrify you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Burgundians exchanged whispers about Siegfried’s strength,
how it were certain death to fight with him, and, moreover, that
he was innocent of all blame in the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then grim Hagen turned to Brunhild, and said, “Lady, it was
against my advice that Gunther went to woo you in Isenland;
but, now that you are our queen, your honour shall be safe in
our hands. I will satisfy your desire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” exclaimed young Giselher, “it is not the way in Burgundy
to return evil for good. Siegfried has always been true
to us, and I, at least, will not be false to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen tried to persuade Volker, the minstrel, to help him in
the work of assassination, for Siegfried was not a man they could
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
attack openly. But Volker refused. Ortwin offered himself in
his stead, saying that the mere fact of Siegfried having given
the ring and girdle to his wife was an insult to the queen of
Burgundy, and must therefore be revenged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gunther here broke in passionately, “Such a murder would
cast dishonour on all Burgundy, and it is my duty as the king
to prevent it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord of the Rhine,” cried Brunhild, rising from her seat, “I
give you three days to think of it. After that, I either go to
Isenland, or have my revenge.” With these words she left the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No weapon can hurt him,” said the Margrave Gere, “for he
has bathed in dragon’s blood, and is only vulnerable in one
place, on which a lime-leaf fell when he was doing it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he guesses what we are after,” added Sindolt, “he and
his thousand Nibelungs will conquer the kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will do it by cunning,” said grim Hagen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king could not make up his mind one way or the other.
He would—and would not. And when the warriors separated,
nothing was settled. Three days later, when Gunther saw that
the queen’s mind was fully made up, he consented with a sigh
to let his uncle Hagen try his plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time heralds came from Lüdegast and Lüdeger
to declare war against Burgundy. Siegfried at once promised to
help his brothers-in-law to defend the country. The ladies were
all busy preparing the jerkins their husbands were to wear. One
day when Chriemhild was thus employed, Hagen entered her
room. He bade her be of good cheer, because the hero having
bathed in dragon’s blood was invulnerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good friend,” she answered sadly, “my Siegfried is so bold
that he often pushes into the midst of the enemy, and, in such a
case, he might easily be wounded in his only vulnerable point.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
Hagen begged her to embroider a little cross upon his jerkin
to mark the place, so that he might always cover it with his
shield. She promised to do so, and immediately worked a little
cross with silver thread upon the garment. Her anxiety was
needless, for the next day fresh messengers came to say that
the kings had changed their minds regarding war, and were now
determined to be true to their old alliance. Soon after this,
Gunther made preparations for a great hunt to be given in
honour of the continued peace. On the morning on which it
was to be held, Chriemhild entreated her husband to remain at
home. She had had such terrible dreams the night before, that
she feared for his life. He laughed at her, and then kissed
her, saying that a bad dream would be a foolish reason for
keeping away from the hunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Besides that, be comforted, dear wife. What harm can happen
to me? I shall be amongst faithful friends and comrades all
day long. I shall take Balmung and a sharp spear with me, and
I should like to see him who would dare withstand me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He kissed her again, and hastened away. She ran to the
window, and watched him until he disappeared from sight. The
morning passed very pleasantly, and then the warriors sat down
to their mid-day meal, which was spread out on the grass. There
was food in plenty, but the wine ran short. Hagen explained
that he had sent the wine on to another place, thinking it was
there they should have dined; but he told his friends of a
cool spring under a lime-tree not far off, and offered to run a race
there with Siegfried. The latter laughingly accepted the challenge,
adding that he would carry his sword and hunting-tackle,
while Hagen went empty-handed, that the race might be more
equal. The two warriors ran across the meadow ground towards
the linden, and, as they ran, the field flowers tried to stop bold
Siegfried, the branches of the trees beckoned him to go back,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
and the birds in the linden sang sadly as though they would
say, “Turn back, noble hero, the traitor is behind you.” But
Siegfried did not understand the language of the flowers, trees,
and birds. He trusted his friend as himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here we are at last,” he cried to the panting Hagen. “Here
is the clear spring; see how the water sparkles. Let us rest under
the cool shade of the linden, until the king comes up, for he must
have the first draught.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He laid aside his sword and other weapons, and threw himself
on the flowery grass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How dull you look,” he continued to Hagen, “and yet it is
such a bright and beautiful day, and we have had such good sport
this morning. Ah, here are the others. Come, Gunther, we are
waiting for you. You must have the first draught.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gunther stooped and drank of the fresh, clear water of the spring,
then Siegfried followed him, saying with a laugh:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I intend to have a real good drink. But do not fear, noble
friends, I shall leave you plenty. This spring is like mankind:
one part goes down into the earth, and another comes up into the
light of day, but it never ends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very true,” said Hagen; “what matters one life more or less?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nibelung hero bent over the well and drank thirstily, and,
as he did so, Hagen caught up his spear and plunged it into his
back, in the exact spot where Chriemhild had embroidered the
silver cross on his jerkin. He did it with such force, that the
point of the weapon went through his back and came out at his
chest. The wounded man sprang to his feet, and, not finding
his sword where he had put it, for it had been removed by one
of the conspirators, seized his shield and struck the murderer to
the ground. More he could not do. He sank back helplessly
amongst the flowers, which were dyed red with his blood. The
silver stream was also reddened, and all the sky was crimson with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
the light of the setting sun. It seemed as if nature were blushing
for the evil deed that had just been done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more the hero feebly raised his beautiful head, and said,
looking round upon the Burgundians:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye murderous hounds, what harm did I ever do you? Had
I known of your treachery, ye had all lain dead at my feet. A
devil from hell must have tempted you to do this foul deed.
None of you ventured to meet me in open battle, and so you
fixed upon Hagen to do the cowardly deed. Your names will
be known until the latest times as those of cowardly traitors.
And now, King Gunther, dishonoured as you are through this
ill-deed, and weak of will, listen to the words of a dying man.
Protect my wife, she is your own sister, protect my poor wife
from Hagen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These were the last words of the royal hero.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warriors stood silently around him, their hearts filled with
sorrow and repentance. Gunther at length said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will tell the people, who all loved the dead man, that he
was murdered by robbers. Chriemhild will never then hold us to
blame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay,” said Hagen, “that may not be. I will not deny what
my own cunning and my own hand have done. Our queen has
now the expiation that she demanded, and your honour required.
Burgundy is safe from all enemies, for no man was ever Siegfried’s
equal, or ever will be. What do I care for the complaints of a
people or for the tears of a woman? Let us make a bier of
branches, that the dead warrior may be borne to Worms thereon.
Ha! here is Balmung, his good sword; to-day it shall do its
old master a last service, and its new master a first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the bier was made, the hunting party set out for Worms
in very different fashion from that in which they had started in
the morning. They did not arrive until late at night. It almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
seemed as though the dead hero inspired both warriors and
serving-men with terror. None of them would carry him up the
staircase. Hagen called them cowardly loons, and raising the body
on his shoulders, carried it up, and laid it outside Chriemhild’s door.
Next morning early the queen got up, and made ready to go to
the sanctuary. She called a chamberlain, and he, seeing a dead
man, whom he did not recognise in the half-light, lying in the
passage, told his mistress. She shrieked aloud:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is Siegfried! Hagen has murdered him at Brunhild’s
command!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The servants brought lights, and they saw that she had spoken
truth. She threw herself on her husband’s body, and with her tears
washed his face clear of the blood stains that marred it. There
he lay before her, pale, cold, and motionless; never, never again
should she hear his voice;—never again. The word rhymed in her
ears, and seemed to madden her. She would willingly have died
with him, and have gone down to the grave; or, as her forefathers
believed, have rejoined him in Freya’s halls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Sigmund, on hearing the news, uttered no word, but his
heart seemed broken. He kissed his son’s wounds, as though he
hoped thereby to recall him to life. Suddenly he started to his
feet, and the old spirit awoke in his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Murder! Vengeance!” he cried. “Up, Nibelungs, up, and
avenge your hero.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hastened into the court, and the Nibelungs, hearing his
words, crowded round him in full armour. The old man received
a sword and coat of mail from them, but his trembling hands were
too weak to hold them, and next moment he had sank unconscious
on the ground. The Burgundians were awaiting the assault
with arms in their hands, and grim Hagen was bringing up new
forces to help those already there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nibelungs retired, gnashing their teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
On the third day after this, the bier was taken to the sanctuary
to be blessed by the priest. The populace crowded into the church,
that they might give a last look at the dead hero, who had done so
much for Burgundy. Chriemhild stood by the uncovered coffin,
which was adorned with gold and precious stones. Her eyes were
tearless, but all could read her sorrow in her face and bearing. A
veiled woman passed close by amongst the crowd. Chriemhild
alone recognised her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go, murderess,” she cried, “do not approach him, lest the very
dead should bear witness against you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Unknown vanished in the crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Burgundian warriors now came to view the corpse, as
custom demanded. When Hagen came up, the wounds of the
dead man opened, and his blood flowed forth in a warm stream,
as at the hour of the murder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not stand there, assassin,” said Chriemhild; “do you not
see how the dead bears witness against you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The bold warrior remained where he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not deny what my hand has done. I only acted as I was
bound to act by my fealty to my liege lord and his queen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If Chriemhild had had a sword in her hand, and had been
possessed of a man’s strength, Hagen had scarcely quitted the
sanctuary alive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many gifts were made to the poor in honour of the dead
hero, who was buried on the fourth day. The grave-chamber
was richly decorated, and over it rose a high mound. Chriemhild
followed the coffin to its quiet resting-place. There the lid was
opened once more at her command. She kissed and wept
over the pale face of her husband. Her women at length had
to bear her away, for she would have remained there for ever.
Hagen was standing without, grim and unmoved as ever, and
said with his usual fatalism, “What has happened, must needs
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
have happened. The will of the Norns must be done.” The
queen did not hear him. She did not even see how Gunther,
Gernot, and many of the other warriors tried to hide their grief
and repentance. Her thoughts were all with the dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sigmund and the Nibelungs prepared to return home. They
wanted to take Chriemhild with them, to guard her from the
false Burgundians, but she would not leave her husband’s
grave, and only begged the old king and the Margrave Eckewart
to take care of her little son, and bring him up to be like
his father. For she said he was an orphan, fatherless, and perhaps
motherless. She had only one wish, which she whispered
in the old man’s ear—the wish for vengeance. Sigmund took
leave of none but the Lady Ute, who mourned for Siegfried
as if he had been a son of her own, and of Giselher, the
youngest of the brothers. Then he set out for the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Time passed on, and it almost seemed as though Chriemhild
had grown content, and had become reconciled to her brother.
Grim Hagen alone seemed to fill her with horror, and Brunhild
she also avoided. She, one day, told her brother that she wished
the Nibelung treasure to be brought up to Worms, as it was her
private property. Gunther rejoiced at this proof of her renewed
confidence in him, and at once consented to send for it. Alberich
delivered the treasure to the messengers without hesitation,
and at length it arrived at Worms. The queen made
generous gifts to the people, and whenever she found a brave
warrior who possessed but few worldly goods, she would provide
him with all that was necessary for his calling, and with
daily pay besides. So that she gradually became complete
mistress of a small army, which grew daily larger, and more
powerful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen warned the kings of this; he told them that the Lady
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
Chriemhild meditated vengeance. He did not care for his own
life, he said, but the fair land of Burgundy must not fall into
her hands. The only way that he could see of preventing this
consummation would be for the kings to take the Nibelung
treasure under their own care. The brothers would not consent.
Gernot said that enough harm had been done to their
sister already without heaping small indignities on her. Once,
when his liege lords were absent, Hagen, who had always considered
that prevention was better than cure, called his men
together, and fell upon the warders who had charge of the
Nibelung treasure. He carried off all that remained of it, and
sank it in the deep waters of the Rhine. It was of little use
that the kings heard of his ill-deed on their return; it was of
little use that Chriemhild made indignant complaint: the deed
was done, and could not be undone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you were not our uncle,” said Gunther and Gernot, “this
should have cost you your life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A short time afterwards, Hagen showed his nephews the
place in the Rhine where he had hidden the treasure, and
made them swear that none of them would betray its hiding-place
as long as one of them was alive. Chriemhild was sad
and sorrowful as before; she always sat with her mother, and
embroidered tapestry in which she depicted the scene of Baldur’s
death, and showed how he was cruelly slain by his
brother Höder, and how Nanna died of a broken heart, and
shared her husband’s bier. But in Baldur every one recognised
the features of her hero, and in Nanna her own; while Höder
had the features, garments, and murderous weapon of grim
Hagen. She often held the needle suspended in her fingers,
and sat watching the picture thoughtfully. When the Lady
Ute asked her, on such occasions, “What are you thinking of,
my child?” she would answer, “I was thinking of Hagen.”</p>

    KING ETZEL’S WOOING.</h3>

<p class='dc11'>
Some welcome guests arrived
at Worms. Margrave Rüdiger
of Bechelaren, surnamed “the
Good,” came with some of his
warriors to the Burgundian court. Gunther, Gernot, and Hagen
were old acquaintances of his, and he had often held young
Giselher on his knees as a child. Now that he came to the
house of mourning, his gentle, noble spirit had such an effect
on Chriemhild that she would sometimes accompany her mother
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
to the hall, and listen to the Margrave with a gentle smile,
such as had not been seen on her face since her hero’s death.
But if Brunhild or Hagen entered, she would go away at
once.</p>
<p class='c007'>Days and weeks passed on, and at last Gunther said to his
guest that he fancied the Margrave had not come merely for
the pleasure of renewing an old acquaintance, but had something
on his mind. Then Rüdiger answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, King Gunther, I will tell you what brings me here.
You know that good Queen Helche, the faithful helpmeet of
my liege lord King Etzel, died some years ago, and that her
sons were slain in battle by Wittich. The king of the Huns has
long sat lonely in the wide halls of Etzelburg, but he has now
made up his mind to marry again. He consulted me on the
subject, and I advised him to try and win the hand of the noble
Lady Chriemhild, your sister and the widow of heroic Siegfried.
If you will give your consent to the match, I am empowered to
say that she shall be queen of the Huns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is no longer under my charge,” was the answer; “she
is queen of the Nibelungs, and of the Netherlands, and I fear
that she will not be willing to marry again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will take her the good news,” said Giselher, “and mother
Ute will advise her to do as we wish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young warrior immediately rose, and went to the women’s
apartment. He found his sister busied as usual with her embroidery.
He told her that it was time she should give up grieving
so much for her dead husband, and reminded her that she was
still young, and might yet be happy. Then he told her what
Rüdiger had related of Etzel’s court, its greatness and its glory,
and finally told her of Etzel’s wooing. But Chriemhild answered
with solemn firmness, that she would not leave the grave-mound
in which all she loved was buried.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>
Then mother Ute spoke. “If you will be Etzel’s queen, my
child, you will be the most powerful of women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most powerful of women,” repeated the daughter thoughtfully.
“Look, Giselher,” she went on, pointing to her embroidery, “you
know whom that hero is intended to represent?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He shook his head, and she added, “It is Wali, the Avenger,
of whom our fathers said that he revenged Baldur, and sent dark
Höder to his own place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“These are old wives’ stories that are forgotten now,” answered
Giselher. “Let us speak of him in whose name good Rüdiger
is come to woo you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—but what if it were to be fulfilled?” she said, “perhaps—Ask
the Margrave to come to me, that I may hear his wooing
myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Giselher left the room, and the Lady Ute went out also, leaving
Chriemhild alone, as she requested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Siegfried,” said the young queen, “it is for your sake that
I leave your resting-place, from whence you have so often come
to me, in waking and in sleep, and pointed to your wounds—those
gaping, bleeding wounds, that will never close until it is
granted me to send grim Höder down to dark Hella.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rüdiger appeared, and in courteous fashion wooed the queen
in his master’s name; but not till he had promised, in the name
of the god Irmin, that she should have men to fight her battles
when she needed them, did she consent to go to the land of
the wild Huns, and to become Etzel’s wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Burgundians all rejoiced when Rüdiger told them the
good news,—the three royal brothers especially, for now, they
thought, their sister would again be happy. But Hagen came
to them, and said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you thinking of, that you thus call the lightning
down on our heads? Do not give your sister to the king of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
the Huns. Between the widow of Siegfried and us, such friendship
alone can exist as that between fire and water. Either must
the one be quenched, or the other fly off in steam. It is a
childish action to supply one’s enemy with a sword to cut off
one’s head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the brothers refused to listen to his warnings. Preparations
now went on apace for the journey to Etzelburg. Ambassadors
were sent to the Nibelungs and to the Netherlands to tell them
of the queen’s contemplated marriage. They returned with a
numerous company of warriors and servants. At length all was
ready, the kings went with their sister as far as the Danube,
where they took leave of her, and Margrave Rüdiger took their
place as leader of the travelling party. At the borders of the
land, King Etzel with a large following awaited the queen’s
arrival. His face lighted up with pleasure when he saw the
pale, beautiful countenance of the Lady Chriemhild. He told
her that she should have full power over his treasures and his
lands,—that, in short, she should be his queen. She answered
that she would be a faithful and obedient wife, but that her love
was buried with Siegfried. The king paid no attention to the
last words. He made sure of winning her love through kindness
and affection. And so they went on together to Etzelburg.
The marriage festivities lasted a fortnight, and were celebrated
in the usual way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild took little part in the rejoicings. She did all that
she had to do, thinking of Siegfried the while. Now, amongst
the warriors present, there was one who was famed for his
unusual strength, bold Dietrich of Bern. His thoughts were far
away in the beautiful land of the Amelungs, which his uncle
Ermenrich had taken from him by guile and force. He longed
to return to his own people, and win the victory for them; but
Etzel would not give him the necessary help. Sometimes, as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span>
sat grave and sad in the great hall, while other men were laughing
and talking, the queen would go to him, and tell him of Hagen’s
foul deed. He understood that she wished to woo him to
vengeance, but he was silent, for he neither could nor would
raise his sword against the Burgundian warriors who had been
his faithful comrades in the olden time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Months and years passed on; a little boy was born to the
royal pair. He was the image of his mother, and received the
name of Ortlieb. The king and country rejoiced equally in
the birth of an heir to the throne. For his son’s sake, Etzel
loved his wife more than he had ever done before, and would
have given her anything she chose to ask; but she cared for
nothing; she remained grave, quiet, thoughtful about her duties,
but sparing of her words. Even her little boy, carefully as she
tended him, did not bring her happiness. She was never seen
to smile even on him. The wound that her first husband’s death
had dealt her would not heal. The spirit of vengeance, rising
out of the abyss, never ceased to whisper in her ears, “Blood
for blood, murder for murder,” and her ears were open to its
cry.</p>

<h3 id='p2c2s2' class='c020'>II. THE BURGUNDIANS VISIT HUNLAND.</h3>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Journey.</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >One day when the king was playing with little Ortlieb, and
speaking to his mother, he said how much he wished that
the child should one day be a hero like Siegfried. She nearly
shrieked when she heard the name, but forcing herself to be quiet,
begged her husband to invite her brothers and their friends to
come on a visit to the land of the Huns. It was the first request
that she had ever made, and so King Etzel was overjoyed to hear
it. He despatched the minstrels Swemmeling and Wörbeling,
with four and twenty noble warriors, to invite the Burgundian
kings to the Midsummer festival. And Chriemhild sent a special
message to her mother, begging her to come too. In spite of
Hagen’s remonstrances, the three kings accepted Etzel’s invitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen prepared for the journey as though they were setting out
on a campaign, and not to a feast. The Lady Ute would have
liked to go, but her age and infirmities hindered her taking so long
a journey. Brunhild also remained at home, for she had no desire
to see her enemy’s good fortune; besides, she had long given
up caring for festivals; she only cared to spend her time near
Siegfried’s grave-mound.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Nibelungs are going to visit the Huns,” said the common
people, as they watched King Etzel’s visitors crossing the Rhine;
for, ever since the treasure had come into the country, the kings
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span>
and their followers had been called Nibelungs, after the unknown
land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The travellers rode for twelve days through the Black Forest
and many waste places, till they reached the Danube. At the
borders of Bavaria neither inn nor ferryman was to be found.
While the rest made preparations to encamp for the night, Hagen
went deeper into the inhospitable land, and came to a spring that
ran into a small lake. There he saw some women bathing in
the clear water, and at once knew that they were swan-maidens.
Seeing him, they swam away, but he got possession of their feather
garments, which obliged them to speak to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give us back our garments,” said one of them, “and I will
tell you of the future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He promised to do as she desired, if she would tell him how
their journey should end. She then prophesied pleasant things
to him, and the hero gave back all the swan-garments. No sooner
had he done this, than another of the maidens informed him that
her sister had spoken words of guile, for that, far from the happy
ending she had foretold, the priests alone of all that numerous company
should ever see the Rhine again; as for the warriors, they
should all die by the sword, if they did not at once return home.
Hagen answered that he was ready to defend himself and his
kings, and then asked how to cross the river. The swan-maidens
directed him where he should find a ferryman, and then flew
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen followed the advice given him, and brought his company
down to the ferry. The boatman turned out to be an old enemy,
so after a hand-to-hand encounter, he was slain, and Hagen took his
place. When they were halfway across the river, Hagen flung
the priest, who accompanied them, overboard, that at least one
portion of the swan-maiden’s prophecy might come to nought.
But he had miscalculated in this instance; the priest’s floating
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
garments upheld him on the turbulent waters, and the current
drove him back to the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The holy man has the devil’s own luck,” said the grim warrior.
“I care not, however. What must be, will be, as the Norns used
to say.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The travellers pursued their journey rather more rapidly than
before. At length, after meeting with several adventures, they
arrived at Margrave Rüdiger’s castle, where they met with a hearty
reception from their old friend and his wife. During their visit
to Bechelaren, Giselher fell in love with fair Dietelinde, the only
daughter of the house, and wooed her through his brother. So,
according to old custom, the youth and the maiden were called
to appear before the whole company in the great hall of the castle,
and say whether they were willing to be man and wife. Giselher
did not hesitate for a moment. His “yes” was loud and clear.
But fair Dietelinde blushed, and looked down, and her whispered
“yes” was only obtained in response to a second demand. Then
Giselher clasped her in his arms, and gave her the kiss of betrothal.
The bond was therefore sealed for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Burgundians, or Nibelungs as they were generally called,
remained at Bechelaren for many days, and when they went away,
their host pressed all manner of costly gifts upon them. Hagen
refused to receive anything in the way of ornament, and only
begged for a strong shield that hung on the wall amongst other
pieces of armour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is Nudung’s shield, and he, our only son, was slain by faithless
Wittich,” said the Margravine; “take it, noble hero, and may
it guard you well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The travellers continued their journey, and arrived at the land
of the Huns, on the borders of which they were met by Dietrich
and many other warriors. Accompanied by these, and by Rüdiger
they at length arrived at Etzelburg. The queen came down to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
meet them in the castle court. She greeted the kings, and kissed
young Giselher, but scarcely seemed to see the warriors who accompanied
them. Hagen was angry, and said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“When one comes as an invited guest, one is accustomed to
hear one’s host at least say ‘Welcome.’ This praiseworthy custom
does not seem to obtain in the land of the Huns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord Hagen of Tronje,” said Chriemhild, “have you done
anything to gain such greeting? Have you, perchance, brought
me some of the stolen Nibelung treasure?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It lies deep sunk in the Rhine,” replied the warrior, “and
there it will remain till the end of time. But had I known that
you desired a gift, I am rich enough to have brought you one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can do without it,” said the queen, “I too am rich; I only
thought you might perhaps have desired to restore to me my own
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I find my shield, helmet, sharp sword, and coat of mail a heavy
enough weight to carry,” replied the hero, “but I promise to try
and bring you the devil. <em>He</em> has much rich treasure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not need your gifts,” cried the queen, “nor do I desire
them. You have served me ill enough in time past with your
murderous and thievish hand. I have not yet requited you for
what you have already done for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned away in anger, and calling her men-at-arms around
her, promised to reward whoever avenged Siegfried’s death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The queen then asked her brothers to divest themselves of their
armour, as it was not customary to appear in the panoply of war
before King Etzel. Hagen at once advised them not to do so,
warning them of the consequences in plain terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild exclaimed, that she would give much to know
whose advice he was following in this matter; then the Amelung
hero came forward, and boldly avowed that it was he who had
given this counsel, for he knew well the devilish plots that were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
being contrived in the palace. The queen only answered him
with an angry look, and at once retired to her apartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the kings talked together in the friendliest fashion, the
Hunnish warriors looked askance at the Burgundians. Hagen,
desirous of showing that he felt no fear, asked one of his comrades
to go with him to the inner court to await the coming of the
queen. His familiar friend, Volker the minstrel, declared himself
ready. They seated themselves on a bench near the queen’s
hall. As they sat there—Hagen with his good sword Balmung
laid across his knees—Chriemhild came down the steps, and
asked him why he had hated her so, and why he had slain the
noble Siegfried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” he said, “I never denied that I did it. The queen
of Burgundy was insulted for his sake, and the royal house
dishonoured. The shame had to be washed out with blood, and
as the hero was too strong to attack in the open field, he had
to be slain by cunning. Any one may blame me, any one may
strive to avenge the deed, I am not afraid. I have no cap of
darkness, and am easily to be found.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Chriemhild turned to her serving-men, and desired them
to slay the slanderer of their queen, and the treacherous murderer
of Siegfried. But the two brave men were so terrible to look
upon, that none of the Huns dared touch them, although the
queen offered them much gold. They then went their way, and
the queen returned to her apartments, blushing with shame.</p>

<p class='c007'>A message now came from King Etzel begging the Burgundians
to visit him in his palace. They accepted the invitation, and he
greeted them like old friends. After having welcomed the heroes,
he said that he should very much like to know who the two
warriors were that looked so brave, and stood so close together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are Volker the minstrel, and my uncle Hagen of
Tronje,” replied King Gunther.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
“What, Hagen!” cried Etzel. “So we have met again at last,
old friend, and I can tell you to your face that you have not belied
the promise of your youth. But you are much changed in your
looks from what you were in the old days when I was proud
of your brave deeds in my service, and set you free, to return to
Burgundy. You have lost an eye since then, your hair is mixed
with grey, and your face has grown so rugged that you might
alarm the boldest warrior when you swing your broadsword.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who can tell,” replied the hero, “how soon I may have to do
it again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never in the land of the Huns,” answered the king; “you, like
all Burgundians, are a favoured guest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening passed quietly, and it was nearly midnight before
the Burgundians were led to the great hall, where couches were
spread for them with down cushions covered with gold embroidery.
They agreed with Hagen that it would be well to keep watch
during the night for fear of surprise, and that each man should
place his weapons where he could get them at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen and Volker kept guard. They had been seated for some
time in silence, when all at once the minstrel saw helmets and
shields glancing in the starlight. He pointed them out to his
companion, who knew that they were the queen’s men, and needed
no telling to inform him on what errand they were come. The
minstrel wanted to spring out upon them, but Hagen prevented
him, because some of the enemy might then have slipped into
the hall, and perhaps murdered their sleeping friends. So peace
was preserved for the time; and at dawn, the Burgundians
marched to the sanctuary to keep the solemn Midsummer festival.
King Etzel appeared with his train, and asked, in astonishment,
why they wore their armour. But they answered that such was
their custom, not thinking it well to tell him what had happened
during the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>
After the service was over, a great repast was served, which was
in turn succeeded by games, dances, music, and other entertainments.
In all feats of arms and trials of skill in the lists, the
Nibelungs showed themselves better men than the Huns. At
length the games appeared to be over, and the warriors desired
to rest after their exertions. As they were leaving the scene of
contest, a prince of the Huns presented himself in shining armour,
and offered to try his skill against the strangers, who, he alleged,
had hitherto only measured their strength with the common
people, and not with the princes. Bold Volker caught his spear
more firmly in his hand, and turned to accept the challenge. His
thrust was so shrewd that he wounded the Hun severely, and
a cry of “Murder, down with the murderer!” arose on every
side. A free fight would have begun in another minute, had not
King Etzel thrown himself between the belligerents, and threatened
death to any of his people who hurt one of his guests.
Peace was then outwardly restored; but the sullen glances each
side cast on the other, showed the angry turmoil in every heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>That evening, Etzel sent for his little son into the hall, that he
might present him to his guests. The warriors all admired the
handsome, frank-mannered child, and told the father that they
did so; but Hagen said he did not think the boy would live to
grow up, he looked so delicate.</p>

<p class='c007'>This speech of Hagen’s increased the bad feeling of the Huns
towards the Burgundians tenfold; but no one betrayed his
thoughts. A little later, a great noise was heard in the court
without—shouts, the clang of armour, howls and cries.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The First Blood. Blödelin and Dankwart</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Before the warriors went to the feast that evening, Queen
Chriemhild had spoken privately to the hero of Bern. She
promised him Etzel’s help in regaining his kingdom, if he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
do her one service—if he would avenge Siegfried’s death. But
he told her that he could not, for the Burgundian warriors were
old friends and comrades of his; besides, he reminded her, that
they had come to Etzelburg in all good faith and loyalty.
A few minutes after Dietrich had left her sad and hopeless,
Blödelin, Etzel’s brother, came in, and told the queen of what had
happened that afternoon in the tilting ground. Seeing how hot
his anger was, Chriemhild thought she might perhaps succeed
in gaining him over to her cause. She therefore told him of the
unavenged death of Siegfried, and promised him a rich treasure
of silver and gold if he would do her will. But he refused, from
fear of Etzel’s anger. Upon which, the wise woman offered him
a margravate in addition, with lands and towers, and the hand
of a beautiful maiden of her court, whom he had long wooed, and
wooed in vain. These promises gained him to her will. He told
her that he would cause a quarrel to spring up between the men
on either side, and if Hagen came to try and settle matters,
he would have him overpowered, and carried to the queen in
bonds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild then retired to her chamber, which was pervaded by
a soft light, the curtains of Indian silk keeping off the rays of the
sun. As she sat there thinking, the words that her mother had
once spoken rushed into her memory. “Women often strike
deeper wounds and shed more blood with their tongues than men
with their swords.” She would have started up, and recalled
Blödelin; but at the same moment she saw, as distinctly as if
it had really been there, Siegfried’s bier with the dead warrior
stretched upon it. She saw him raise himself, and stretch out his
arms to her; but when she started forward to meet him, there was
nothing but empty air. She determined now to go on to the bitter
end. Whether her vengeance brought about the death of her
little son, and of King Etzel; whether it brought about the destruction
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
of the kingdom, she did not care. She could die, and
die willingly, if only she had the murderer’s life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime, Blödelin was making his preparations. His men
were rejoiced to hear the news he brought them, and followed
him joyously to the hall, where Dankwart the Marshal, Hagen’s
brother, had charge over the serving-men. The hero rose from
his seat to greet the prince, who exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Prepare to die. The queen demands a bloody atonement for
the death of the great Siegfried.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why should I have to expiate a murder of which I knew
nothing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That cannot be helped,” said the Hun; “my men’s swords
cannot return unstained to their sheaths.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I am sorry that I gave you words of peace. I shall
now give you your answer with cold steel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With that he drew his sword, and swung it so lustily at the
warrior’s neck that his head fell to the ground at one blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild shrieks and shouts of vengeance arose, and all prepared
to take part in the fight that had become inevitable. Dankwart
made his way fighting to the hall, his armour bespattered with
blood; but the defenceless serving-men were slain to a man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Up, brother Hagen!” he cried, “save me from the faithless
Huns. Lord Blödelin attacked both me and the servants, in order
to avenge Siegfried’s death. I slew him, but the servants are all
dead, and I alone am escaped out of the traitorous toils that the
Huns have laid for us.”</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Slaughter.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The fight recommenced in the banqueting hall, in spite of all
King Gunther’s efforts to smooth matters over, and during the
struggle the little Prince Ortlieb, the sole hope of Etzel’s house,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
was killed. At length Hagen, Dankwart, and Volker, succeeded
in locking and bolting the doors of the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Etzel and the queen sat full of anxious care during the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i>.
Dietrich and Rüdiger, neither of whom took part in the fight, were
also grave and sad. At length the hero of Bern exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen to me, Nibelungs. Hearken to my words, ye friends
of Burgundy. Grant me a truce that I and my men and Margrave
Rüdiger may go away unharmed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>King Gunther recognised Dietrich’s voice, and said: “If any
of my warriors has done harm to you or yours, noble hero of Bern,
I shall take your cause into my own hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No one has done me harm,” replied the warrior; “all that I
request is that you should let us go freely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the good of so much requesting?” cried hot-headed
Wolfhart; “we have sharp keys to unlock the doors with, even if a
thousand such as these Nibelungs tried to keep them shut.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush! hush! foolish comrade,” said Dietrich; “there was but
little sense in that speech of yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>King Gunther then commanded his people to open the door,
and much to the wrath of the Burgundians, Dietrich passed
through their ranks with Chriemhild leaning on one arm and King
Etzel on the other, and followed by his six hundred warriors.
After them came Rüdiger with four hundred men. Giselher said
to the Margrave:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Greet your daughter from me, and say to her that I shall
think of her even in death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the Huns tried to escape with King Etzel, but Volker
cut them down as they strove to pass the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner were Dietrich and Rüdiger safely gone than the horrible
carnage recommenced. The Burgundian swords had no rest,
until all the Huns were lying dead or dying on the floor. After
that the Nibelungs rested awhile from their labours, but Hagen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
speedily called them to be up and doing, and fling the corpses out,
lest they should be in the way in any renewed attack. He was at
once obeyed. The dead and wounded Huns were one and all
flung into the court below.</p>

<p class='c007'>Volker and Hagen now guarded the entrance, lest the enemy
should unexpectedly break in.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Etzel wrung his hands, and moaned over the slaughter
of so many good men and true, Chriemhild offered a shield full of
gold and jewels to whoever slew her deadly foe, Hagen of Tronje.
Of all who heard her, one alone came forward and said that he
would try and do her will. And he was Count Iring of Daneland,
Haward’s man.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went forward boldly and performed prodigies of valour, but
at length was beaten back, and fell dead under Chriemhild’s
window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Haward and Irnfried of Düringen (Thuringia) determined to
avenge bold Iring, so they called out their men and went to the
attack. The fight began at the door, where Irnfried fell under the
minstrel’s sword, and immediately afterwards Haward was slain
by the hero of Tronje. But still the men of Daneland and
Düringen fought on unheeding, and Hagen exclaimed,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give place. Let them go through the door, out of which they
shall never come back alive. Volker shall play them a slumber-song
to which our swords can beat the accompaniment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the Nibelungs opened their ranks, and the men of Daneland
and Düringen entered the blood-stained hall. Once more the
battle began. Many a brave Burgundian fell to rise no more; but
not one of their enemies escaped alive.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Parley and the Fire.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Silence fell on the palace. The Nibelung warriors laid down
their shields and heavy armour, that they might the better rest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
from their labours, while Hagen and Volker kept watch by the
door. During this time of quiet, the Burgundians tried to make
peace. They reminded King Etzel that they had come to his
land at his own invitation, and relying on his good faith, only to
meet with treachery from him and his. But Etzel demanded that
the Burgundians should acknowledge him their feudal superior.
Then Giselher turned to his sister and asked what harm he had
ever done her that she should behave in such a way. And even
the women, who were weeping for their husbands and sons, bore
him witness that all his life had been spent in doing good to
others. Chriemhild was touched by his appeal, and told him that
he, Gunther, and Gernot should go free with all their warriors and
men-at-arms if only they would give up the murderer Hagen, that
she might punish him as he deserved. But with one voice the
Nibelungs refused terms which were dishonourable in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Enraged at the boldness of her foes, the queen called upon the
Huns to make one more assault, and drive them out of the house.
Again the bitter strife began. Chriemhild knew no more compassion.
She commanded her servants to set fire to the upper part
of the house, which was built of wood, and soon the flames were
seen spreading over the whole roof, which at length fell with a
crash. A wild wail of human creatures in their last agony accompanied
the fall. After that the queen retired to her own apartments,
and standing at the window overlooking the house where
her brothers and their friends must have been burnt, thought sadly
and half remorsefully over the past. Only half remorsefully, for
she felt her heart as full of hatred to Hagen as it ever had been.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the Nibelungs had not perished in the flames, as
Chriemhild fondly imagined. The great vaulted hall in which
they had entrenched themselves was too strongly built to have
suffered much from the fire in the wooden upper storey; though
the Burgundians were for a long time as if shut up in an oven, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
heat was so terrific; they yet escaped with their lives; and Hagen
made them slake their intolerable thirst by drinking the blood of
their fallen enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Huns at length came to look for their charred
bodies, they were not a little surprised to find themselves confronted
by six hundred brave and utterly undaunted warriors.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Slaughter Again.—The Lord of Bechelaren.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The queen heard with astonishment that the Nibelungs were
still alive and armed for a new fight. While she pondered
what it were best to do, one of the Hunnish notables told her
that she should apply for help, either to the Margrave of
Bechelaren, who had received so many benefits from the king,
or to Dietrich of Bern, who had enjoyed Etzel’s hospitality so
long as a fugitive. Chriemhild thought the advice good, and
at once sent off a message to Rüdiger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The noble Margrave immediately obeyed the queen’s summons.
Etzel explained to him the true position of affairs, and reminding
him of all the honours that had been heaped upon him,
told him the time was come to prove his gratitude. He must
punish the Nibelungs for the great scath they had wrought
to the royal house and to the land of the Huns.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My liege,” said the good old hero sadly, “all that you have
said is true, and I am ready to do you any service, however
dangerous, but do not ask that I should break the faith I swore
to them when they stayed with me at Bechelaren, before I led
them to Etzelburg at your command. They trusted me utterly,
and young Giselher chose my daughter to be his wife, and to
share the Burgundian throne. Methinks it were an ill deed
to raise my hand against them that trusted me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the king reminded him of his oath of allegiance, he
continued,—</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span>
“Take back my castles and towns, the wealth that you have
given me, and the possessions I have won for myself. I will
go penniless into the wide world with my wife and child, and
what is my best wealth, Honour and Truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, noble Margrave, but you cannot do so,” replied the
queen, “if you fail in obedience. Think of the time when you
came to Burgundy to woo me for Etzel. I feared to go alone
amongst the barbarous Huns, where I had not a friend or helper,
and you swore to me with a solemn oath that you would help
me against every adversary, except your liege lord. Your
sworn faith to me is older than that which you promised to
the Nibelungs. If you break your oath to me, you are dishonoured.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rüdiger stood in silent thought before the queen. At length
he said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take my head. I shall not even tremble when the executioner’s
sword touches me. But do not force me to do what
my conscience disallows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversation lasted a good while longer. At length
Rüdiger with a heavy heart consented to obey the king and
queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Nibelungs stood by the window looking out for help.
On seeing the noble Margrave approach with his men, Giselher
exclaimed joyfully that all was not lost, that they should see
Bechelaren and the Rhine again. When Rüdiger came close to
the door he explained his errand. Gunther reminded him of
the friendship they had sworn, and Rüdiger answered sadly
that the oath he had sworn to Etzel’s wife forced him now to
fight her battle. And so they took fair leave of each other, as
noble friends forced to fight against their will. Once more the
blood of the Nibelungs and their opponents stained the great
hall. The heat of battle raged anew in every heart, and many
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
men were slain. Amongst the number were Rüdiger and Gernot.
At length the men of Bechelaren were conquered, and slain
to the very last man. Two hundred Nibelungs also fell before
this victory was gained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes were silent in the wide hall. They heard the
sound of voices in the court without. The queen’s voice was
raised in indignation, as she accused the Margrave Rüdiger of
playing the false traitor and making peace with the Nibelungs.
Volker’s anger was roused at this unjust suspicion. Leaning
out of the window, he told her not to vex herself on that score,
nor accuse a good man falsely, for the hero of Bechelaren had
died serving her. He then commanded the Margrave’s body
to be shown at the window, so that the king and queen and
all the Huns should see it. Etzel uttered a loud cry of horror,
and cursed the hand that had done the deed. He called for
his sword, that he might himself lead the band of avengers,
but he forebore to unsheath it when he saw that terrible pair
(Hagen and Volker) still guarding the threshold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild stood looking on with folded arms. She was
beautiful as ever, but it was now the beauty of a fallen angel.
She shed a few tears for the loss of her old friend Rüdiger.
Perhaps also because she feared that he was her last ally.
She may likewise have pondered whether by any means she
might yet attain her end. But be that as it may, the next
events were unexpected by her as by every one else.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Dietrich and his Amelungs.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>One of Dietrich’s men heard what had happened. He
hastened to his master and told him the strange tale. Dietrich
refused to believe it, and sent Helfrich to the palace to find
out the truth. On hearing the news of Rüdiger’s death confirmed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
the hero of Bern sent his old master Hildebrand to ask
the Nibelungs why they had done this evil deed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The master would have gone unarmed upon this errand, but
Wolfhart cried out upon the folly of appearing as a lamb in the
presence of wolves. The master thought the advice good, and
put his armour on. When he was on the way, he saw that all
Dietrich’s men were following him well-armed, under Wolfhart’s
guidance. He desired his quick-tempered nephew to go back,
but the latter refused point-blank, saying that he could not
let his uncle go alone; and the other warriors, one and all, declined
to leave him. When the small band of five hundred brave
men came in front of the house the Nibelungs were defending,
Master Hildebrand lowered his shield, and asked if it were true
that good Margrave Rüdiger was dead. Hagen answered that
they wished it were untrue, but it could not be helped, for he
had been slain in unavoidable fight. The Amelungs mourned
aloud for their friend. Wolfhart would have avenged him on the
spot, but the master held him back, threatening him with
Dietrich’s anger if he thrust himself into the quarrel. Then,
turning to the Nibelungs, he demanded in the name of the hero
of Bern that the Margrave’s body should be handed over to
them, that they might give him honourable burial. King
Gunther replied that it was a good and worthy desire on their
part, and one that ought to be gratified. Wolfhart called to them
to make haste and bring out the body, upon which Volker
said that they were too tired to do more work, so the Amelungs
might come in and fetch it.</p>

<p class='c007'>One word led to another, till Wolfhart lost his temper altogether,
and rushed forward, followed by the Amelungs, shouting
as with one voice their ancient war-cry. Master Hildebrand,
drawn on in the general rush, was found in a foremost
place when the battle began. The tired Nibelungs, and the brave
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
Amelungs—men who had formerly fought side by side in the
great battle of Ravenna, and on many other fields—were now
engaged in hand-to-hand conflict for life and death. Here was
strong Sigestap, duke of Bern, there brave Helfrich, there the
bold heroes Wolfwin, Wolfbrand, Helmnot, Ritschart, and others,
all burning to avenge the death of Rüdiger. The confusion was
so great that often those who wished to meet could not find
each other. Thus Volker and Wolfhart were kept apart; the
minstrel fell upon Sigestap, who had slain many of the Burgundians,
and gave him his death-blow, only to meet Hildebrand
a little later and himself to fall under his hand. Dankwart
was slain by Helfrich; Wolfhart did many a deed of valour,
until Giselher attacked him. After a tremendous struggle, the
young king thrust him through the breast, but even then,
though in mortal agony, he grasped his sword in both hands,
and slew his adversary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Hildebrand saw his nephew fall, and hastened to him. He
lifted him in his arms, and tried to bear him from that hall of
doom; but he was too heavy. The wounded hero opened his
eyes once more, and said in a faint voice,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle, tell our friends not to weep for me, for I have met my
death at the hands of a brave king, as he has at mine. My
wild blood has grown calm and still, and I am ready to sleep
peacefully like a tired child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These were the last words of the wildest, hottest warrior in
Dietrich’s train. Like Wolfhart, all the other comrades of the
hero of Bern, save Hildebrand alone, lay stretched on the bloody
floor; and with them all the Burgundians, except Hagen and
King Gunther.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come now, Master Hildebrand,” cried a rough voice, “you
owe me satisfaction for the death of my comrade Volker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Hagen that spoke. The meafdtelsmer defend his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
bravely, but the hero of Tronje was strong and determined, and
Balmung was sharp. One terrible blow cut through Hildebrand’s
coat of mail, and the blood flowed freely from his side.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The End of the Nibelungs.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>When the old man felt the wound, and looked in the grim,
rugged countenance of his antagonist, for the first time in all his
long life fear took possession of him, and covering his back with
his shield, he fled like a coward.</p>

<p class='c007'>With shattered armour, and red with his own blood, and that
of others, the old man came before his master. Dietrich asked
whether he had fought with the Nibelungs, and why he was so
wet with blood. Then Hildebrand told how the Burgundians had
slain the good Rüdiger, and had declined to give up his body
for burial.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero of Bern was so saddened by these tidings, that he
asked no further questions; he begged the old man to command
his comrades to arm themselves at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whom shall I command?” asked the master.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The swordsmen of Bern are all here. You, my lord, and I,
are all that remain of them; and of the Nibelungs, Hagen and
King Gunther are the only ones alive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At first Dietrich did not understand, and when he did, he
mourned aloud for his friends and comrades.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How could my brave men have fallen under the swords of
these tired warriors? Who will now help me to regain the land
of the Amelungs?”</p>

<p class='c007'>So he cried in his sore distress. But soon, mastering his
emotion, the hero prepared to avenge his fallen friends, and,
accompanied by the master, went full-armed to the house where
Hagen and Gunther awaited their fate with undaunted courage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen and Hildebrand exchanged so many scornful words
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
when they met, that Dietrich chid them for a couple of old
women, and demanded that the combat should at once begin.
Hagen sprang forward without delay. Balmung was as sharp as
ever it had been, and the hero of Bern had much trouble to defend
himself; but the hand that wielded the sword was weary, and
less nimble than of yore. Dietrich, seeing this, made a sudden
spring upon Hagen, threw him down, and bound him fast. Then
he bore his prisoner into the presence of Chriemhild, and recommended
him to her mercy, saying that he was the boldest
and bravest warrior in the whole world. He only noticed the
thanks and praise she gave him for his doughty deed, and did not
mark the gleam in her eyes, nor rightly interpret the flush that
rose to her cheeks. He hastened away to the last battle with
King Gunther.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild had gained her end: that end to which she had
waded through rivers of noble blood. Hagen read his fate in
her eyes; but he never flinched: he would not give her that dear
satisfaction. She wondered whether she could make him confess
where he had hidden the Nibelung treasure. She spoke to him
kindly, and promised to let him go safely home, if he would only
tell her the hiding-place. The hero seemed touched by her
gentleness, and said that he would willingly tell her, but that he
had sworn to keep the secret as long as one of the three kings
of Burgundy was alive.</p>

<p class='c007'>She promised him again that she would keep her word, if he
did her will; and then had him taken away to sure watch and
ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lies, lies, all lies,” he said to himself, as his gaolers led him
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero of Bern soon afterwards appeared with King Gunther
as a prisoner; the latter was at once taken to a separate dungeon
Chriemhild considered what was now to be done. Siegfried’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
murderers were now in her hands, both the man who had done
the deed, and the king who had condoned it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She felt a few qualms of conscience when she thought that
Gunther was, after all, her brother; but she soon stifled them,
and calmly pursued the path she had marked out for herself.
King Gunther’s head was cut off by her orders, and laid at
Hagen’s feet to convince him that now the last king of Burgundy
was dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero thrust away the head contemptuously. “It was not
thou,” he said, “to whom I swore allegiance, and whose crown I
strove to keep free from stain. The royal house of Burgundy, to
which I belonged, is wasted, and its glory overthrown. Of what
worth to me is the span of life that remains?”</p>

<p class='c007'>That night Chriemhild had a happy dream. She thought that
Siegfried stood before her as she had seen him first; that he
stretched out his arms to her in love and gratitude, and then
vanished slowly in the grey dawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning Chriemhild seated herself beside King Etzel in
all her robes of state. The hero of Tronje was brought before
her, a prisoner, and in bonds. She questioned him again as to
the hiding-place of the treasure. Raising his head, he answered
with all his former boldness:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are mistaken, woman, if you think that you have my
mind in your power, that you have tamed me entirely. The
kings are all dead now, Gunther, Gernot, Giselher; now none but
God and I know where the treasure was sunk in the deep waters
of the Rhine, and from me you shall never learn where you may
seek with any hope of finding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Chriemhild silently came down from the throne, and picked up
the good sword Balmung that lay beside Hagen’s armour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You took good care of the gold you stole from me,” she said,
“but another thing that you stole I have in my hands at this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
moment. My noble husband Siegfried wore this sword when
last I saw him, before he fell under your murderous hand. I will
now try whether it be strong enough to avenge its master.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had drawn the sword from its sheath, and now swung
it with both hands, and with such force that the head was cut
from the body, and fell at the feet of old Hildebrand.</p>

<p class='c007'>A cry of horror echoed through the hall, then all was still.
Chriemhild thrust the bloody weapon back into its sheath, and
said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“This blood may never be washed from the blade. Balmung
must be taken to Worms as it is, and laid in Siegfried’s grave.
Perhaps he may then learn that his wife loved him faithfully,
and punished his murderer. Two things alone made up my
life: Love and Revenge. My work is done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Strange,” said Hildebrand, staring at the hero’s dissevered
head, “that the bravest warrior in all the world should have
been slain by a woman! But although he wronged me much
of late, I will yet avenge him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, the old master drew his sword, and gave the
queen her death-blow. Etzel shrieked out, and threw himself
on his knees beside his wife. She was deadly pale, and had
only strength to gasp rather than speak,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let none touch the old master for this,” she said, and they
were her last words.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>At Etzelburg.</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Great as was the misfortune that had come upon the
people and the royal house, the burial of the dead had
yet to be seen to as speedily as possible. King Etzel was too
full of his own grief to attend to business of any kind, so
Dietrich and Hildebrand gave all necessary orders, and themselves
helped in the sad work.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the dead were buried with every honour, save and except
the hero of Tronje, who was forgotten. The grave-mounds were
filled and closed, before the old master remembered the brave
warrior, whose headless trunk still lay in the audience-hall.
Hildebrand ordered that he should receive instant burial. So a
separate grave was prepared for him, and there he was laid
with all his armour, except the good sword Balmung, which was
to be taken to Siegfried’s grave, according to Chriemhild’s wish.
Many of the Huns went with the funeral procession; they neither
wept nor made moan for the dead man whose strong right
hand had brought so much evil on their native land. Next
spring lovely flowers decked the other grave-mounds, while on
Hagen’s thistles and thorns alone were to be seen, in the midst
of which a venomous adder had found its home. All who had
gone near enough to the snake to examine it carefully, maintained
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
that it had only one eye like the hero of Tronje, and
were firmly convinced that it was the form his spirit had taken.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>At Bechelaren.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Dietrich and Hildebrand sent news to Bechelaren and to
Worms of all that had occurred. They chose the noble minstrel
Swemmeling as their ambassador, for they knew that he was
tender-hearted, and would break the news as gently as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Margravine and her daughter sat by an open window,
watching the clouds that rose in the east. Godelinde felt
strangely anxious, a presentiment of evil overpowered her, and
she could not resist telling her daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>She said that she feared evil news was coming, for she had
dreamed the night before that Queen Helche had appeared to
her, surrounded by the Burgundians, and many other warriors
in full armour. “The queen,” added Godelinde, “said that she
wished all these heroes to go with her. She took your father
and Giselher by the hand, and led them away, the others
following. I wished to join the procession, but she signed to
me to go back. Then they all vanished in a grey mist, out
of which a hill seemed to rise like——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was interrupted by sounds of arrival. It was the procession
of mourners who had come under Swemmeling’s guidance.
The Margravine recognised Rüdiger’s horse and armour, and
the meaning of her dream was clear to her. But in the midst
of all her grief, she tried to keep up, that she might comfort
her daughter, who sat at her side, pale with terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>The minstrel joined the ladies. The Margravine rose to meet
him, and said it was needless for him to tell his tale, for she
knew what had happened. A few moments later, they were
able to listen to what Swemmeling had to say; so they asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>
him how the noble Rüdiger had met with his death. He took
up his harp, and sang a song of the heroes who had kept
their faith, and had conquered in the battle of life. He told
how they come to the realms of Woden and of Freya, how they
float over earth and sea, and how they speak to their friends
in the breath of the wind and in the rustling of the leaves,
and thus bring them comfort in their sorrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that he gave them all the details of what had occurred
at Etzelburg. On the following day Swemmeling had to continue
his journey. A few weeks after his departure, the Margravine
died of grief, and Dietelinde was left alone. She remained alone
for a long time, but when Dietrich reconquered the land of the
Amelungs, he took the orphan from Bechelaren, and brought
her to his wife, the noble Herrat, at whose court she won the
love of a bold warrior, whom she afterwards married.</p>

<p class='c007'>Swemmeling made his way to Worms as rapidly as he could.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>At Worms.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile things were going on very quietly at Worms.
Queen Ute would sit spinning by the hour together, humming
many a weird ditty, but seldom speaking. Queen Brunhild
would sit by her side embroidering the death of Baldur, which
she copied from old patterns. Curiously enough, the white god
was not like the pattern, but rather resembled Siegfried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, mother Ute,” she said. “Is it not strange that, in
spite of all my efforts, the picture will resemble Siegfried, as he
looked that day when he rode out hunting for the last time.
It is a sad story, and reminds me of an old legend that I used
to hear in my childhood, in Isenland, in which a murder was
committed for the sake of possessing a magic sword. It seems
to me that when Hagen comes back, I must get him to give
me Siegfried’s sword, Balmung, that I may restore it to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
dead hero. Otherwise I fear that Burgundy will suffer as Isenland
suffered through the theft of that other sword.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither Hagen nor any of the others will ever return to
this house, on which the sin of bloodshed rests, as yet unexpiated,”
said mother Ute; and, breaking off, she began to hum
one of her strange, weird ditties, which was so gruesome that
none could listen to it without a shiver. About this time
Swemmeling arrived, and told the queens of the journey to the
land of the Huns, of the friendly reception the Burgundians had
met with from King Etzel, and then of the quarrel, the battle,
and its fatal results. No plaints, no weeping, no questions,
interrupted the minstrel’s tale. When he came to an end, the
Lady Ute said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a sad tale, very, very sad, but it could not have been
otherwise, for much heroic blood was needed to wash away the
curse of murder from this house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither did Brunhild weep. She made all necessary arrangements
for the comfort of her guests. She asked that the good
sword Balmung should be given to her, and, looking at the blood-stains
on the shining blade, she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grim Hagen stole this weapon out of Siegfried’s grave. I will
take it back to the hero, now that it has been dipped in the blood
of his murderer, that he may rest in peace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She went to the grave-mound with the sword, and did not return
that day, nor during the night. When they sought her, they
found her lying dead beside Siegfried’s coffin, on which she had
laid Balmung.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lady Ute went on spinning for many a day, and as she
span, she hummed a song of the snake-queen who murdered her
own brood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Burgundian nobles, and all the people, mourned for their
royal house and the fallen heroes. But when feuds arose in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
kingdom, they united, and raised the young son of Gunther and
Brunhild to the throne, appointing brave men to act as guardians
for the king so long as he remained a child.</p>

    <h2 id='p2c3'><i>THE HEGELING LEGEND.</i></h2>

    <h3 id='p2c3s1'>I.<br />
    HAGEN.</h3>

<p class='dc12'>Zealously strove the knights
in tilt and tournament to uphold
their country’s honour before Sigeband their king, when
he held the Midsummer feast at his high castle of Balian in
Ireland. Sweetly the minstrels sang the praise of warlike deeds;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_308' id='Page_308'>308</a></span>
and eagerly did boys of noble birth contend in games of hurling
the spear and shooting with the bow. But evermore did little
Hagen, the king’s son, bear him best in the gentle strife; and
the heart of his mother, the Lady Ute, was pleased.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day the boys were amusing themselves by throwing their
spears at a target. Having thrown them all, they ran forward to
get their weapons again, the prince among the rest. As he could
run faster than his companions, he reached the target first, and
was busy pulling out his spear, when an old man called to the
children to run back and hide themselves, for danger was
approaching. He pointed up at the sky, crying, “A griffin!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lady Ute looked, and saw a dark spot in the sky. It
seemed too small to be dangerous. But it approached with the
swiftness of an arrow, and the nearer it came the bigger it grew.
All could now hear the noise made by its wings, and the sound
resembled the rushing of the storm. The other boys fled in terror,
but Hagen stood his ground boldly, and flung his spear with all
his childish strength at the great bird. The weapon grazed its
feathers harmlessly, and, at the same moment, it swooped down
upon the child and bore him off in its talons.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the feasting and mirth that had reigned at Castle Balian
were turned into mourning, for the heir to the kingdom was
gone. There was no hope of rescue; for though many a hero
would willingly have fought with the griffin, its flight was so
swift that no one could see where it was gone. Years passed
on, and the king and queen had no news of their boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The griffin carried Hagen over land and sea to its nest, which
it had built on a rock rising out of the water. It gave the boy
to its young ones to eat, and then flew away in search of new
booty. The little griffins fell upon the child, and prepared to
devour him, but he made ready for his defence, thrust back their
bills with all his strength, and caught the birds by the throat
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
striving to throttle them. At length one of the griffins, which
was old enough to fly, caught him up, and carried him to the
branch of a tree, that it might enjoy the sweet morsel alone.
The bough was too weak to bear their united weight; it bent,
broke, and the monster fell with the boy into a thicket of thorns
beneath. The griffin fluttered away, and Hagen crept deeper
into the thicket, unheeding the thorns. At length he reached a
dark cave, where he sank down utterly exhausted. When he
came to his senses, he saw a little girl of about his own age
standing a little way off and looking at him in astonishment.
He raised himself on his elbow to see her better, upon which
she fled to a greater distance, and no wonder, his appearance
was so frightful. He was dirty, wounded, and bleeding, and
his clothes hung about him in rags. He limped and crept as
well as he could after the girl, and found that she had taken
refuge in a large cave with two companions. They all shrieked
when they saw him, for they thought he was either a wicked
dwarf or a merman, who had followed them to devour them;
but when he told them that he was a prince who had been
carried off by the griffin, and had only escaped from the monster
as by a miracle, they were comforted, and shared their
scanty fare with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that they told him their story, which was much the
same as his own. He found that the girl he had first seen was
called Hilde, and that she was an Indian princess; the second
was Hildburg of Portugal; and the third came from Isenland.
The maidens nursed their young companion with such care that
his wounds were soon healed. When he was well again, he
went out to provide the needful food, and ventured deeper into
the land than the maidens had ever done. He made himself a
bow and arrows, the latter of which he tipped with fish-bones,
and brought home small game of all kinds. As the children
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_310' id='Page_310'>310</a></span>
had no fire, they were obliged to eat their food raw, but they
became all the stronger and hardier for that, and when Hagen
was twelve years old he was almost a man in size.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the young griffins were grown up, and were able
to go out in search of food for themselves, so that the boy could
no longer wander about as freely and fearlessly as before. Nevertheless,
one evening he ventured down to the shore, and crept
under an overhanging rock which hid him from view. He looked
out at the foaming waves and the wild sea, which now looked
dark as night, and again was lighted up by the vivid flashes of
lightning that burst from the storm-clouds. He listened fearlessly
to the loud peals of thunder, the howling of the wind, and the
sound of the frantic waves dashing against the rocks. But suddenly
he caught sight of a boat, struggling in unequal conflict
with the elements, and his heart was filled with hope and fear;
of hope, because thoughts of home and his parents were awakened
in his breast; of fear, because the boat seemed too weak to live
on such a sea. Then he saw it drive upon a point of rock. There
was one shriek of agony, and ship and crew were swallowed in
the waves. The storm raged on, until morning came, and seemed
with its soft light to calm the fury of the winds. On the strand
were scattered pieces of the wreck, and the corpses of the luckless
mariners. Hagen was going to sally out in hopes of picking up
something useful, when he was stopped by hearing the whirr of
griffins’ wings, and knew that the great birds had come down
to the shore, having scented the prey. While the monsters were
busied with their meal, the boy crept out of his hiding-place in
search of something to eat. But he only found drift-wood, and a
drowned man in full armour, with sword and bow, and a quiverful
of sharp-pointed arrows. He could have shouted aloud for joy,
for now he had arms, such as he used to see at his father’s court.
Quickly he donned the coat of mail, covered his head with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_311' id='Page_311'>311</a></span>
helmet, girded the sword to his side, picked up the steel bow and
the arrows. It was high time, for at this moment one of the
griffins swooped down upon him. He drew his bow with all his
strength, and the arrow struck his enemy in the breast, bringing
it down with fluttering wings. It fell at his feet, dead. A second
monster shared its fate, and now the three other birds attacked
him all at once; but he slew them all with his sword. He took
the heads of the dead monsters to his friends in the cave, who had
passed a wakeful night in anxiety for him. Great was their joy
when they found that the griffins were dead. They accompanied
their hero to the place of his victory, they helped him to throw
the great birds into the sea, and then, true to pious custom, they
assisted him to heap up a mound over the dead warrior whose
weapons had helped Hagen to victory. Vainly did they seek
for provisions among the wreckage; but they found a well-preserved
box with flint and steel, which enabled them to make a
fire. So they were now able to enjoy a well-dressed meal, which
after their former privations seemed a perfect banquet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen went out hunting much more frequently than before,
and slew bears, wolves, panthers, and other wild beasts. Once,
however, he met with a curious creature. It was covered with
shining scales, its eyes glowed like red-hot coals, and horrible
grinders gleamed in its blood-red jaws.</p>

<p class='c007'>He aimed a sharp arrow at its back; but the point glanced
off the glittering scales, and the monster turned upon the lad. A
second arrow was likewise without effect. Hagen now drew his
sword; but all his efforts were useless, and he only escaped the
terrible claws by his marvellous agility. When he was almost
exhausted by the long struggle, he at length saw his opportunity,
and plunged his weapon into the great jaws. Overcome with
fatigue, he seated himself on the still heaving body of the creature.
He longed for a few drops of water to quench his thirst, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_312' id='Page_312'>312</a></span>
as none was near, he eagerly drank of the blood that streamed
from the monster’s wounds. Scarcely had he done this, when
his weakness vanished, and an unaccustomed sense of power took
possession of him. He sprang to his feet, longing to put his new
strength to the test. He would not have hesitated to fight all
the griffins and giants in the world. He drew his sword, and
slew a bear with one stroke. In like manner he killed two
panthers, and a rhinoceros. He was covered with blood from
head to foot, and looked so ferocious carrying the bear on his
shoulders, that he frightened the maidens in the cave; but he
regained his accustomed manner when he had seen the gentle
Hilde.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many years came and went. Hagen and his three friends
had enough to eat and drink, and were clothed in the skins of
wild beasts. Although they were very happy together, they
longed to get back to the haunts of men, and often cast anxious
looks over the sea in hopes of seeing some ship approach. At
length one morning, when the three maidens were standing on
the shore, a white sail appeared on the horizon, and came gradually
nearer and nearer. They lighted a fire, and called Hagen,
who joined them fully armed. Their signals were seen from the
ship, and a boat was sent out, which soon approached the shore.
The helmsman uttered a cry of astonishment when he saw their
strange dress, and asked if they were human beings or water-sprites.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are poor unfortunate people,” said Hagen; “take us with
you, for God’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the sailors took them to the ship, and they were soon on
board. The captain looked at them in amazement, and Hagen,
in answer to his questions, told their whole story. When he spoke
of his father Sigeband, the powerful king of Balian, the captain
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_313' id='Page_313'>313</a></span>
“What! you can kill griffins like flies! Still you are a lucky
catch for me, for I am that Count of Garadie to whom your father
has done so much injury. You shall now be hostage till a
proper sum of money is paid to me. Here, men, put this young
fellow in chains, and steer for Garadin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Scarcely had the Count said these words when Hagen fell into
a Berseker rage. He flung the sailors, who would have laid hold
of him, into the sea: then, drawing his sword, he rushed upon
the master of the vessel, when a soft hand was laid upon his arm.
He turned round furiously; but at the sight of Hilde’s gentle,
lovely face, his terrible anger vanished. Hilde spoke gentle words
of conciliation, and Hagen listened. Then, turning to the Count,
he promised to make all matters right between him and the King,
if he would at once steer for Balian. The captain agreed to
do so, and steered for Ireland. Favourable winds swelled the
sails, and ten days later the walls and towers of Balian hove in
sight. Naturally his parents did not at first recognise Hagen;
but great was their rejoicing when they found who he was. A
firm peace was concluded with the Count of Garadie, and the
three maidens were received with all honour and courtesy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen did not long remain quietly at home in his father’s house.
He wished to see something of the world, and to gain both name
and fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Time passed on, and Hagen, who was known far and wide for
his great deeds, was appointed to rule the land in his old father’s
place. When urged by his mother to choose a wife, now that he
had settled down after his wanderings, he wooed fair Hilde, the
sweet companion of his childhood, and soon afterwards married
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Ute lived to hold a grandchild in her arms, who was
called Hilde after her mother; but soon after that she and Sigeband
died, leaving their son to rule alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_314' id='Page_314'>314</a></span>
The Princess Hilde grew up beautiful, and many wooers came to
Balian to ask for her hand in marriage. But Hagen would receive
no man as a son-in-law without first fighting with him, declaring
that he would never give his daughter to one that was not stronger
than himself. Whoever ventured to try conclusions with him
had the worst of it. Wild Hagen, the terror of kings, became
also the terror of wooers, and before long, he really had his house
to himself.</p>

<h3 id='p2c3s2' class='c020'>II. HETTEL THE HEGELING AND HIS HEROES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Now about this time King Hettel the Hegeling lived at Castle
Matelane in Denmark. He was a bold warrior, and Nordland,
Friesland, and Dietmarsch owed him allegiance. Many
princely heroes were about his throne. Chief among them was
his kinsman, old Wate, who bore rule in Sturmland, and was
famous for his doughty deeds of war. Not less celebrated were
the minstrels Horand and Frute, both powerful lords in Denmark.
Then came Irold the Swift from Friesland, and Morung of Nifland;
bold warriors both, and ever ready to help their liege lord.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening, at the feast, Morung of Nifland advised King
Hettel to seek a wife, and said that Hilde, the Irish princess,
was the best maid for him to woo, for she was famous in all lands
for her beauty and virtue. And Horand answered, that the lady
was justly praised; but that wild Hagen, her father, would permit
no man to woo her, and that many a noble warrior had met his
death in fighting with him for her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king was much taken with what he heard of fair Hilde,
and greatly desired to raise her to the Hegeling throne. He
asked who would undertake the wooing for him. The courtiers
advised him to make old Wate his ambassador, and although the
lord of Sturmland had no desire to go on any such errand, yet
he promised to set out, and said that if Horand and Frute would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_316' id='Page_316'>316</a></span>
accompany him he had no doubt the wooing would be successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three warriors, joined by Irold of Nordland, prepared to set
out on their journey. They took a small fleet of ships laden with
costly wares, and a thousand armed men, and started on their
mission.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a long voyage they reached Balian, where wild Hagen
held his court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their arrival was greeted with the utmost amazement, for no
one in Ireland had ever seen such splendour before. The masts
of the Danish ships were of shining cypress-wood, the sails of
purple silk, and the anchors of silver. Sailors in rich garments
bore foreign wares from distant lands out of the ships, and
spread them before the astonished multitude. The captains
offered rich articles for sale, explaining that they were merchants,
and had come to Balian on a trading expedition.</p>

<p class='c007'>When King Hagen heard what was going on at the wharf, he
and Queen Hilde went down to the ships to see what was to be
seen. Then Frute at once came forward, and, drawing him aside,
explained that they were not really merchants, but fugitives, who
desired to be protected from their king, Hettel the Hegeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hagen laughed when he heard this, for he had long wished
to try his strength in single combat with the Danish king. So
he told the warriors to be of good courage, and to come up to
the palace with him. The strangers accepted the invitation.
They gave the king and queen rich presents of garments and
precious stones. Indeed, their riches seemed so inexhaustible,
that Hagen would willingly have kept them in the country, and
given them houses and lands. But they pleaded that they had
left their wives and children in Hegelingland, where they hoped
one day to return.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all met in the banqueting-hall, and the strangers were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_317' id='Page_317'>317</a></span>
presented to the princess. Wate alone spoke little, and often
looked out towards the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go, Hilde,” whispered the queen, “and greet the foreign lord
with a kiss.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl started with fear, for the hero of Sturmland was a
full head taller than any of his comrades, and was a stern-featured
man, with a large hooked nose, bald head, and long grey beard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you looking at, Lord Wate?” said the queen. “Do
you see fairer women on the shore than here in the hall?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am looking at my ship,” answered the hero, “for a storm
is coming on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the princess smiled and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you not happy with us, noble warrior? or do you always
wish to be out among storms and fighting?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady,” said Wate, “I never learned to talk sweet talk with
women, or to dance with girls. I only care for the dancing of
the stormy waves and for the din of battle, when the Norns sing
of conquest or a glorious death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the speech of the stern old man. But the other
warriors talked of the lovely land of the Hegelings, of its
castles and granges, and of the minstrels and knights who
served their ladies in all honour and modesty. After this they
took leave of their hosts and retired. The next day passed, as
was usual on such occasions, in jousting, feasting, and minstrelsy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Horand used to sing, early in the morning and in the late
evening, before the queen and her daughter, who were both delighted
with his voice and his songs. Once, when he was alone
with the princess, he sang about a great king who fell sick with
love for a beautiful maiden named Hilde. The princess felt
that there was something hidden behind the song. So she
asked at length who the king was that cared for her. Upon
which the minstrel showed her a portrait of King Hettel, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_318' id='Page_318'>318</a></span>
told her of her father’s stern cruelty to all noble warriors who
came to Balian to woo the princess. He told her also on what
secret mission he and his friends had come, and entreated her
to come with them to Hegelingland, where the king was waiting
eagerly for her arrival. Once there, he continued, he would sing
to her every day, and so would King Hettel, who knew far more
beautiful songs than he.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hilde promised that she would ask her father’s permission to
go down to the ships and look at the strangely beautiful stuffs
and jewels on board.</p>

<p class='c007'>What she promised she did.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day the men of Hegeling came before King Hagen, and
said that they had good news from their home. Their king
had found that they had been falsely accused, and had therefore
restored them to his favour. They wished now to take leave of
Hagen, and return to their own land. The king was displeased
to think of losing his guests, and yet they should not go without
rich gifts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire,” said Frute the Wise, “we are so rich that we cannot
well accept either silver or gold; but if you would show us a
kindness, come on board our galleys with the queen and her
ladies, and look at our treasures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Hagen shook his head, but his daughter and the queen
wished so much to go that he at length gave way.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the appointed hour, when the sails were spread and the
ships were ready for departure, the king, queen, princess, and
their ladies appeared upon the strand. Boats were ready to
take them to the ships. Fair Hilde and her maid sprang
quickly into a boat steered by Horand. But when Hagen and
his armed followers were about to get into another boat, Wate,
Frute, and Irold thrust them back and pushed off from land.
The wild chieftain immediately caught up his spear, and rushed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_319' id='Page_319'>319</a></span>
into the sea till the waves dashed over his head. Spears were
hurled on either side, but Horand brought the princess safely
to the ship. Hagen ran along the shore and called despairingly
for ships and men to pursue the traitors; but the Irish boats
were not ready for sea, and even at that moment the sails of the
Hegelings were disappearing in the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The voyage lasted many days and many nights. Fair Hilde
wept much for her father and mother, but Horand sang to her,
now of great deeds, and now of love, till she was comforted. At
length they reached the coast, where King Hettel awaited them.
He came down to meet them, and soon gained fair Hilde’s heart.
On the following morning they prepared to go to Matelane. But
when they were about to start, they saw white clouds appear on
the western horizon, which, as they came nearer, were discovered
to be ships forming a great fleet, and from the topmast of each
ship floated the banner of the cross. The Hegelings took it to
be a fleet of crusaders going out against the unbelieving Wilkin-men
or Reussen; but very soon a flag was hoisted bearing the
arms of Hagen, a tiger, and then they knew that the enemy
was approaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>King Hettel and old Wate drew out their men in battle array
on the strand. The old man laughed loud for joy that he was
really to have a passage of arms with the warlike Irish king.
The other princes advanced with their men to prevent the
enemy’s landing. The warriors were all of good cheer; but
fair Hilde, who looked down from the battlements of the castle
on the turmoil below, wrung her hands with grief that she
should be the cause of bloodshed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The galleys cast anchor, and boats were put off filled with
armed men. The battle began, and so firm was the resistance
made to their landing that the boatmen could not approach the
shore. Then wild Hagen flung himself into the water and fought
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_320' id='Page_320'>320</a></span>
his way to land, followed by his bravest men. His blows were
so terrible that he carried all before him, and even Hettel fell
wounded to the ground, and was with difficulty borne away
from the field. Old Wate now came forward, and he and
Hagen had a hand-to-hand encounter. Each fought like a lion,
and neither gave way in the least before the other, although both
were severely wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length King Hettel, his head bandaged, and looking pale
from loss of blood, forced his way through the throng of combatants
with Hilde leaning on his arm. He threw his arms
round Wate, while she did the same to her father, and entreated
them both to make peace for her sake.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Hagen was touched by his daughter’s words. He clasped
her in his arms, and then held out his hand, first to Hettel, and
then to the grim old hero of Sturmland.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that the battle was over, Wate went about binding the
wounds of all whom he found, whether of Irish or Hegeling birth,
with some healing herb, of whose virtues he was well aware. In
the evening there was a great feast, and next morning the
warriors all went to Matelane, where the marriage was to take
place. A ship was sent to bring good Queen Hilde to her
daughter’s wedding, which was celebrated in the cathedral, with
all pomp and circumstance.</p>

<h3 id='p2c3s3' class='c020'>III. GUDRÛN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >King Hettel and fair Hilde lived happily at Matelane,
and the men of Hegeling, Friesland, and Dietmarsch, were
faithful subjects, out of love and gratitude for the justice and
protection afforded them by their liege lord. Two children were
born to the royal pair, Ortwin and Gudrûn (pronounced Goodroon),
both of whom were strong and blooming as Nordland roses. As
the boy grew older, he was given into the charge of the hero of
Sturmland, that he might learn all that it became him to know
from the greatest warrior in the land. Gudrûn remained at home
with her parents, and was instructed by her mother, both by
precept and example, in all woman’s work and knowledge. So
she grew up, and became celebrated in every land for her beauty,
her gentleness, and her wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many noble princes came to woo her while she was yet very
young. Among them was the proud Moorish king, Siegfried,
gigantic in height, and brown of hue. With many kings for
tributaries, he felt himself so great, that he feared no refusal.
Queen Hilde, however, thought the hero too arbitrary in his
manners, and ignorant of the proper way to treat women.
Hettel was of the same opinion; so he told the wooer that the
maiden was too young to be able to conduct a royal household.
The Moorish king returned to his distant realm in great anger
and disgust. But before leaving Matelane, he had bribed some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_322' id='Page_322'>322</a></span>
faithless men with gold to keep him informed of all that went
on in the land of the Hegelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, at this time, King Ludwig ruled over Normandy and
the neighbouring lands. He was a great and warlike king.
His son, Hartmut, was like his father in character, and helped
him in his wars. When the latter heard of Gudrûn, he determined
to woo her for his wife. King Ludwig thought it a
mistake, because the maiden’s grandfather, Hagen, had once
been his feudal superior, and had never forgiven him for having
freed Normandy from the Irish yoke; also he believed that
Queen Hilde had inherited her father’s temper. The Lady
Gerlind, Ludwig’s queen, was of a different opinion: she thought
that Hartmut was worthy of the noblest wife in Christendom,
and that, if they only set about the matter in the right way,
his offer would be accepted. The young warrior was pleased
with his mother’s counsel, so ambassadors were sent to the
Hegeling court, bearing rich presents. Queen Hilde accepted
the gifts with gracious courtesy, thanked the ambassadors for
bringing them, and added that she supposed the lord of Normandy
wished to pay off an old debt which he owed her father
as his liege lord. The warriors were kindly treated, although
the king and queen heard their message with displeasure, and
said that the husband of their daughter must be of higher birth
than the lord of Normandy. The ambassadors, seeing that no
good would come of their further stay, returned to Ludwig with
their evil tidings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Norman king was not much surprised at the result of
the embassy; but the Lady Gerlind, whose ancestors had been
powerful kings, chafed under the affront, and advised her son
to avenge the insult with his sword. But the young prince had
thought of another plan. He possessed strongholds and granges
in Scotland. So he determined to go a-wooing himself in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_325' id='Page_325'>325</a></span>
Scottish garb, accompanied by a large train of attendants. He
was a hero, learned in all knightly duties, tall, manly, and
strikingly handsome. He was accustomed to ladies’ smiles, and
to meet with kindness from women wherever he went; so he
never for a moment doubted his power of winning the love of
the Princess Gudrûn. The ships were manned, a favourable
wind filled the sails, but soon fell again, and the voyage was
a very slow one.</p>

<p>GUDRÛN ON THE SHORE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, another suitor had arrived at Matelane. This was
bold Herwig, lord of Zealand. He was a brave warrior, celebrated
in many a victory; a faithful friend and loyal foe. Fair
curls surrounded his face, and his blue eyes shone with intelligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The maiden and he soon learned to understand each other,
and before a word of love was spoken, each knew the other’s
feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Hartmut arrived, in the guise of a Scottish prince, he
soon discovered what was going on.</p>

<p class='c007'>A favourable chance led Hartmut to the garden one day, and
there he found Gudrûn alone. He told her of his love, and at
the same time explained who he was. She was startled, but
soon recovering herself, answered that she cared for some one
else. She further told him to beware how he betrayed his
identity, for her father and mother regarded King Ludwig as
a vassal, and his life would be in danger if they knew his name
and quality. The word vassal brought an angry flush to the
young hero’s cheek; he did not, however, betray his feelings,
but took leave of the maid in seemly fashion, and, after saying
farewell to the king and queen, set sail for his own land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herwig lingered on at the palace in the hope that he might
find some opportunity of seeing and speaking to the princess
alone. But, whether by accident, or because the queen prevented
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_326' id='Page_326'>326</a></span>
it, he never found his opportunity. So he went boldly to the
king, and made a formal offer for Gudrûn’s hand. Hettel
listened to him calmly, and told him that the maiden was too
young to marry. This, however, was merely an excuse, for he
really thought the king of Zealand was too poor a match for
his peerless daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herwig found no rest at home. He assembled his forces,
and prepared to invade the land of the Hegelings. His army
only consisted of three thousand warriors, but they were one
and all tried men of valour, on whom he could rely. Hettel
was totally unprepared for the invasion. His heroes were at
their own homes, or scattered abroad; but he collected what
men he could, and went out against the foe. Soon the clang
of arms sounded on the strand, and the battle began. It raged
fiercely for a long time. At length Queen Hilde, taking Gudrûn
with her, and followed by her ladies, descended to the place
of combat, and spoke so wisely that she soon induced the men
to put up their weapons, and make peace. Hettel was so much
pleased with the boldness and valour displayed by Herwig, that
he consented to receive him as his son-in-law, but stipulated
that the marriage should not take place for a year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herwig spent some time at Matelane in company with certain
other warriors, and at midsummer, young Ortwin and several
of his friends received their swords at the hands of old Wate
of Sturmland, who bade them act in all things so as to be soon
worthy of the honour of knighthood. At the jousts that followed,
the young men’s prowess gladdened their teacher’s heart.
But the rejoicings came to a sudden end through the arrival
of some wounded men from Zealand, who brought news that
the Moorish king, Siegfried, had fallen upon the island, and was
laying the country waste.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hettel determined to send troops to help Herwig against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_327' id='Page_327'>327</a></span>
Moors; but the king of Zealand would not wait until they
could be summoned; he set out at once, saying that they could
follow, and he would meantime go and show his people that
he had not deserted them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herwig landed in a small bay. His heart was wrung when
he saw the devastation caused by the cruel Moor, and knew
that he was not strong enough to offer him battle. But he
was not idle for all that. He and his three thousand followers
separated into companies, cut off isolated bands of free-booters,
and harassed the enemy as much as they could. So
matters went on for days and weeks. At length the Hegeling
fleet arrived with Hettel and his heroes. A great battle was
fought by sea and land, but, although the Moors suffered terrible
loss, both in men and ships, it was by no means a decisive battle.
Siegfried knew that he had now no hope of winning the victory
in open war, but still he trusted to the chapter of accidents to
get him out of his difficulties. And he did not hope in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whilst King Hettel and his heroes were fighting in Zealand,
Hartmut, with a large Norman army, had fallen upon the land
of the Hegelings. Ludwig had accompanied his son. Together
they had stormed the palace at the head of their men, had
taken it, and had carried away the Princess Gudrûn and her
maidens; amongst whom was Hildburg, granddaughter of that
Hildburg whom Hagen found on the griffin’s strand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first messenger, who brought the news of the Norman invasion,
was soon followed by a second, with tidings of the storming
of the castle, and the carrying off of Gudrûn. The first thought
in every mind was to set off in pursuit of the robbers; King
Hettel sent to offer terms to Siegfried, telling him at the same time
of what had chanced, and the Moorish king immediately offered
to help to rescue the princess; so an alliance was concluded
between Hettel, Herwig, and Siegfried without more ado.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_328' id='Page_328'>328</a></span>
This being settled, they turned their attention to the ships; but
great was their despair when they found that most of them had
been burnt in the fight, and of those that remained very few were
seaworthy. Herwig and his men would have started alone in the
few vessels that remained, but Irolt the Frisian stopped them, by
drawing their attention to a fleet that was already approaching the
shore. The masts and flags of the coming ships all bore the sign
of the cross, and on deck were figures in long grey garments, with
the staff of peace in their hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are pilgrims going to the Holy Sepulchre,” said Horand
the minstrel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pilgrims disembarked and pitched their tents on the strand,
to enjoy a little rest after their long and toilsome voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Necessity knows no law,” said Wate. “These pious men must
put off their journey for a little. They have plenty of time to do
their penance in. Let us borrow their vessels and provisions. If
we return, we can reward them richly for the enforced loan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Horand and Frute warned their friends that such a deed would
surely bring its punishment. The pilgrims raised their hands in
piteous entreaty. All in vain. King Hettel decided to take the
ships, and Wate and Herwig voted with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the heroes sailed over the high seas in pursuit of the Normans,
in ships that bore the cross as their pennon.</p>

<p class='c007'>After many days’ sail they saw before them a low flat island,
called the Wölpensand, and on it a great army was encamped, upon
whose banners was depicted a raven with widespread wings, the
ensign of the Normans. They were able to get quite close to the
land, thanks to the pilgrims’ ships, before their real character
was discovered. But no sooner was it known, than the Normans
sprang to their feet, and shouting their battle-cry, stood ready
to defend themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle began. Lances and arrows filled the air, and many a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_329' id='Page_329'>329</a></span>
deed of desperate valour was done on either side. Darkness alone
put an end to the fight. The victory was undecided. It was
a dark and cloudy night, and the flickering watch-fires alone
threw any light upon the scene. Then it was that King Hettel
challenged Ludwig to single combat, telling him that he should
always regard him as a coward if he did not at once arm him
for the fray. Ludwig accepted the challenge, and came out to
meet the king. Many a shrewd blow did the heroes exchange
before Ludwig at length gave his adversary his death-wound.
Seeing their leader fall, the Hegelings rushed forward shouting their
battle-cry, and a general engagement took place in the darkness.
None could tell friend from foe, and many a brave warrior fell
under his comrade’s spear. The leaders on either side ordered the
horns to blow the recall, and the two armies took up their position
at a greater distance from each other than before. Knowing the
vengeance the Hegelings would take on the following day, the
Normans thought prudence the better part of valour, and set sail
for home under cover of the night, taking their prisoners with
them; for they were on their way home from Hegelingland.</p>

<p class='c007'>At daybreak, old Wate called his men to be up and doing.
Great was the astonishment of all when they found their enemy
flown. Wate and Herwig were keen to follow the Normans without
loss of time, but Frute and Morung advised them to be prudent.
They reminded them of the numbers of men they had lost,
and advised that they should go home, and wait till the young
men, who were growing up, should be old enough to bear arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wisdom of this advice was recognised by all. Herwig alone
felt indignant, but he was powerless to act unaided, so he returned
to Zealand to work for his people, until the time should come to
renew the expedition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Hilde was sad at heart when she saw the Hegelings
return vanquished, and without either her husband or daughter.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_330' id='Page_330'>330</a></span>
But what could she do? She was only a weak woman, unable to
wield a sword, to avenge Hettel or to save Gudrûn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Horand, Morung, and Irolt mourned the dead king with her,
but old Wate chid them for women, and bade them rouse themselves,
and teach the youth of the land all warlike accomplishments,
to the end that they might win the day when the time for vengeance
came.</p>

<h3 id='p2c3s4' class='c020'>IV. QUEEN GERLIND.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Meanwhile the Norman fleet had reached its destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Gerlind, her gentle daughter Ortrûn, their ladies,
and many of the citizens of Cassian went down to the harbour to
welcome the heroes home. After they had greeted the kings, Ortrûn
hastened to sad Gudrûn’s side, and, embracing her, told her to be
of good courage. Gudrûn was touched by the maiden’s kindness,
though it could not stop her tears; but when Queen Gerlind
would have kissed her, she recoiled from her touch, for the sharp-featured
woman with the bold, glittering eyes seemed to her a
spiteful snake, ready to dart on his prey and crush it in his coils.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh, pretty puppet,” said the offended queen. “What, so shy?
But you’ll soon grow tame under my training.” She would have
said more, but Hartmut interposed, saying that Gudrûn was to be
his wife when the days of mourning for her father were over. He
then offered the princess his arm, and sorely against her will, she
had to enter the palace side by side with him. Some of the townsfolk,
watching her, said, “How beautiful she is!” to which others
made answer, “But how sad!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Days and weeks passed on. Hartmut did his best to win fair
Gudrûn’s love, but all his efforts were vain. One day he asked her
why she would not love him, and she replied that he was a great
and noble warrior, well worthy of a woman’s love, but she was
betrothed to Herwig, and would never break her troth. Queen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_332' id='Page_332'>332</a></span>
Gerlind was not of so patient a disposition as her son: she was
determined to break Gudrûn’s proud spirit, and force her to consent
to marry Hartmut. At first she tried soft words and flattering
speeches; but finding these of no avail, she had recourse to sterner
measures, though she waited till her son had left home on a warlike
expedition. Before going he confided Gudrûn to his mother’s care,
telling her she might “try to tame the wild bird” in any fashion
she liked, that was not inconsistent with the maiden’s royal dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner was Hartmut gone, than Queen Gerlind set to work.
She made Gudrûn dress like a servant, and then set her and
her maidens to cook and sweep, and do all the hardest work in
the palace. Gudrûn bore her wrongs in patient silence. Her soft
hands were blistered with scrubbing pots and pans, and doing
other kitchen work, with which she was busied from early morning
till late at night. The queen would sometimes ask her viciously
if she would not rather wear the Norman crown than continue
to slave in that manner, but she answered gently that she would
keep her troth.</p>

<p class='c007'>So she did all that was given her to do through the hot
summer days, and in the icy cold of winter, without uttering a
single murmur at her hard fate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Year after year she lived this wretched life. At length Hartmut
came home victorious from his wars. He greeted his father,
mother, and sister with warm affection, and then looked round
for Gudrûn. When he saw her dressed in coarse clothing, and
doing hard work, he was very angry with his mother for her ill-treatment
of the girl. He begged Gudrûn to forgive what was past
and gone, and grant him her love, trying to rouse her ambition by
dwelling on the wealth and greatness of the kingdom he offered
to share with her. But Gudrûn answered that a noble-minded
woman could love but once, and never again. So he left her, but
took care to protect her from Gerlind’s malice.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_333' id='Page_333'>333</a></span>
Gudrûn was restored to her former position, and slept that night
in her old room. Next morning, when she awoke, she found the
princess Ortrûn, whom she had not seen for a long time, bending
over her. The two girls spent the summer together, and learnt
to love each other warmly. As autumn came on, Gudrûn thought
that her friend looked graver and sadder than her wont, and
asked her the reason of the change. Ortrûn then confessed
that as Gudrûn had not given way to Hartmut’s entreaties, but
remained obdurate as ever, Gerlind intended to separate her
daughter from the Hegeling princess.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the two girls were talking, Hartmut joined them, and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady Gudrûn, the warrior to whom you plighted your troth is
not worthy of your love, otherwise he would not have allowed so
many years to pass without coming in search of you at the head
of his men. He has forgotten you, and is most likely married to
another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not know him, noble hero,” answered Gudrûn; “death
alone, which looses all bonds, could separate us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What if he has fallen in battle, or has died of some illness?”
asked the young king.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then he shall find me faithful when I join him where there is
no more parting,” replied the princess, with a look of courageous
resolve.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Hartmut took leave of her, and again went away to try and
forget her amid the excitement of battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he was gone, Queen Gerlind once more deposed Gudrûn
from her high estate, and sent her to wash the clothes, making her
work from early morning till late at night, and threatening her with
the rod if she were lazy; but the princess worked too hard to give
her an excuse for inflicting this last indignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>More years passed on, and at length Hartmut returned victorious
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_334' id='Page_334'>334</a></span>
as at first. He spoke to Gudrûn, but found her faithful as
ever to Herwig.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gerlind, after this, was harder than ever to Gudrûn. The other
Hegeling maidens were given lighter tasks than she. They had to
spin and card flax and wool, while their beloved mistress had to
wash the clothes all the cold winter through, and often, on her
return from the shore, she sank into an exhausted sleep on her
straw pallet, without having the strength first to take off her
wet garments. At last matters came to such a pass that her cousin
Hildburg could hold her peace no longer, and asked the queen how
she dared treat a princess with such cruelty and disrespect. Upon
which Gerlind set her to join her mistress in her work.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was just what Hildburg wanted. Her great desire was
to be with her mistress, to cheer and comfort her, and lighten
her toil. Still Gudrûn had often to go down to the shore alone
when Hildburg was busy at the castle. On one of these occasions
she saw a swan come swimming over the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O swan, had I thy wings, I would soar into the sky and hie
me to my home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While she spoke, the swan dived into the sea, and in its place
up came a mermaid:</p>

<p class='c007'>“O heart long tried and true, thy grief shall pass away: thy
lover and thy kindred live, and lo, they hasten to thy rescue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, the mermaid dived, and again the white swan floated
on the wave. He spread his wings and rose in the air, flew three
times round the princess, and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“True love on the earth may yet be found,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>True hearts that never roam;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lo, through the breakers’ foam</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis thy warrior’s bark o’er the wave doth bound,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To lead his true-love home.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic052'>
<img src='images/i_336.jpg' alt='MEETING OF OLD FRIENDS.' class='ig052' />
<p>MEETING OF OLD FRIENDS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was well for Gudrûn that she had this secret hope to support
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_337' id='Page_337'>337</a></span>
her, for Gerlind’s cruelty grew daily more intolerable. The princess
and Hildburg were forced to wash the clothes on the sea-shore,
dressed in simple linen shifts, and without shoes. When they
begged for shoes, the cold was so terrible, their taskmistress gave
them insulting words, and threatened to scourge them with thorns
if their day’s work were not finished by evening. Trembling with
cold in the cutting east wind, and their beautiful hair blowing about
their faces, they worked on busily. Suddenly they saw a boat
gliding swiftly along the shore, rowed by two warriors in full
armour. The maidens, ashamed of their insufficient clothing,
would have fled, but the men called to them to stop, and tell them
what castle that was on the height above. When they added that
they would throw the linen into the sea unless they received an
answer, the girls came back, and as they did so, Gudrûn whispered:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“See, it is Herwig. I know him well, but he—he has forgotten
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And in good truth the hero was unaware that his long-lost bride
stood there before him; but no sooner had she pushed her fluttering
hair back from her face, than he recognised her, hastened to
her, and clasped her in his arms. When the other warrior opened
his visor, Gudrûn exclaimed, “Ortwin!” and threw herself into
her brother’s arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Ortwin turned to her companion, and said, taking her hand
in his:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is you, Hildburg! Do not be ashamed to confess that
you and I have long loved each other, and would have been
openly betrothed years ago, had not the Normans carried you
off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They then exchanged the kiss of betrothal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herwig wished to take the two girls away with them at once, but
Ortwin would not consent. He said they must come openly on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_338' id='Page_338'>338</a></span>
morrow for Gudrûn and Hildburg, who should never run away
secretly from their captors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two girls stood on the shore watching the boat as long
as it was in sight. At length Hildburg in startled accents
begged her friend to help her to finish the washing. But Gudrûn
answered proudly that the days of her slavery were over, and,
so saying, she cast one garment after another into the sea, and
watched them floating away on the waves with a smile; while
poor Hildburg tremblingly remembered that they were still in
the power of the Norman queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they reached the castle, Gerlind came down to meet
them, asking why they were so early, and what they had done
with the linen. Gudrûn answered that the work was too hard
for them, and that she had thrown the clothes into the sea, where
Queen Gerlind’s men might find them yet, if she did not delay
too long in sending out boats. The queen was dumb with
astonishment when she heard the gentle, patient Gudrûn speak
to her in such a manner; but soon recovering herself, she
called her bond-women to fetch thorny rods, and beat the
maidens for their insolence. The women hastened to do as they
were desired; but Gudrûn called to them to stop, telling them
to touch her at their peril, for she would be their queen on
the morrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And will you really marry Hartmut?” asked Gerlind joyfully.
“I fear there is some trick in this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring the king here,” said Gudrûn; “I would speak with
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The queen went thoughtfully to her son, and said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hartmut, that obstinate girl has given in at last, and has
consented to be your wife, but....”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No ‘but,’” cried the hero, “she consents!—mother, I must hear
her say so with her own lips,” and he hastened from the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_339' id='Page_339'>339</a></span>
When he saw Gudrûn, he would have clasped her in his arms
but she signed to him not to approach her, telling him that
she could not listen to him in the abode of her misery; but
that next morning, in the full light of day, and in presence of
all the warriors, she would receive, and give the bridal ring.
Hartmut now gave orders that Gudrûn should be provided with
all that was necessary for the comfort and well-being of the
future queen, and that her maidens should be restored to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>His orders were fulfilled. The princess and Hildburg kept
their secret well. It was not till the Hegeling maidens were all
safe in their sleeping chamber that they heard of the arrival of
Ortwin and Herwig.</p>

<h3 id='p2c3s5' class='c020'>V. BATTLE AND VICTORY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Before day-break one of the maidens stationed herself at
the window, and gazed anxiously over the sea. After some
time she saw vessels full of armed men approaching the shore;
and, with difficulty restraining a cry of joy, she wakened her
mistress and told her the good news. Not long after, the alarm
was given from the tower, where the sleepy watchman had just
woke up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Gerlind had her wits about her more than any one else.
She did not need to be told who the enemy were, and had
given the requisite orders to the garrison before Ludwig’s and
Hartmut’s eyes were well open. But when the kings were ready,
they countermanded her orders, and instead of defending the
castle, marched out to meet the foe in spite of all her warnings
and entreaties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each party moved forward to meet the other in close array;
and no sooner had they met than the battle began. Ortwin
and Hartmut fought hand to hand, and Ortwin had well been
overthrown, had not bold Horand struck up the Norman’s spear.
But he too was unable to withstand the king, and was soon
afterwards carried to the rear by his men, severely wounded.
Meantime Herwig and Ludwig had met, and after a terrible
combat, the latter was slain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The king is dead!” cried his men, and they fled incontinently,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_341' id='Page_341'>341</a></span>
pursued by the victor, strong Irolt, and Siegfried the Moor.
The old hero of Sturmland pressed the advantage. His sword-arm
was never still for a moment, and he was always in the front
rank. When the terrified Normans fled to the castle, they found,
to their horror, that he was close behind them. They only got
the great gate shut just in time. But Wate was not to be done.
He shouted to his men to bring up ladders and storming tackle,
meaning to scale the wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hartmut, ignorant of his father’s death, had continued to fight
bravely, till he saw that the Normans were flying. He then
retreated slowly to the castle with his immediate followers.
Looking up at the battlements, he saw Queen Gerlind giving a
man a naked sword, and pointing with fierce earnestness to the
women’s apartments in the castle. He knew his mother, and
feared that she was telling the man to go and murder the
Hegeling women, so he exclaimed in a loud voice of command:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Coward! If you raise your hand to murder any woman, I
will have you hung before sunset.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man let the sword fall to the ground, and slunk away.
At this moment Hartmut, to his intense amazement, caught sight
of old Wate at the castle gate. He looked round for help,
but Ludwig was nowhere to be seen; on every side waved the
banners of the Hegelings and their allies, and their foremost
men were fast closing round him and his little band. Hartmut
was too brave to fly; he prepared to defend himself to the last.
The lord of Sturmland now came forward to attack him; and
although he fought desperately, it had gone ill with him, if
Herwig had not thrown himself in the old warrior’s way, and
pleaded for his rival’s life. In the heat of the conflict, Wate
did not notice who it was that addressed him; he brought down
one of his sledge-hammer blows on Herwig’s head, and the king
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_342' id='Page_342'>342</a></span>
of Zealand was stretched unconscious on the ground beside many
a dead and dying Norman. This restored the wild lord of
Sturmland to his senses. Leaving Hartmut alone, he bent over
his friend, and, to his joy, discovered him to be whole and sound.
As soon as Herwig was on his feet again, Wate asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What devil possessed you to make me spare the life of that
Norman robber?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No devil at all,” replied Herwig; “the noble Gudrûn loves
the Princess Ortrûn, and, for her sake, begged that Hartmut’s life
should be spared.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Women, women!” cried the old warrior. “They are all
alike. They have soft hearts, as easily moved as a fleecy cloud
is blown by the breeze. But now let us haste, and trap the
she-wolf in her lair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the castle gate was burst open, and the hero of
Sturmland cut his way through the small crowd of defenders
to the women’s apartments. There he found Gudrûn surrounded
by all the frightened women in the palace, while Ortrûn and
Gerlind knelt at her feet and entreated her protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is the she-wolf?” shouted Wate. “Speak, Gudrûn,
and you others!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was awful to look upon, with his grim, stern face, his armour
and sword dripping with the blood of his enemies; but Gudrûn
did not quail, nor did she utter a single word to betray the
cruel woman who had used her so badly. She sat still and
quiet, full of a gentle dignity, and looked at the angry old man
without blenching.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic055'>
<img src='images/i_343.jpg' alt='' class='ig055' />
<p>GERLIND AND ORTRUN AT GUDRÛN’S FEET.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He cast a quick glance round the room in search of Gerlind,
and as he did so, one of the maidens pointed to the queen.
The moment he saw the glittering, snaky eyes, he caught Gerlind
by the hair, and dragging her to the battlements, cut off her
head, and flung both it and the body over the wall.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_345' id='Page_345'>345</a></span>
“Now the other!” he cried, rushing up to the terrified Ortrûn;
“she belongs to the serpent’s brood, and must share her mother’s
fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Gudrûn held the maiden tightly clasped in her arms, and
told the grim warrior of all the love and tenderness that Ortrûn
had shown her, so Wate was fain to be satisfied with the vengeance
he had already wreaked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the fighting outside the castle had also ceased. The
Norman hero, weary to death, had surrendered with the eighty
warriors that were left him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days later, the victorious army went on board their
ships, and set sail for the land of the Hegelings, leaving Morung
and his men to garrison Cassian. Hartmut, and Ortrûn with
thirty of her maidens, had to accompany their conquerors. On
their way they touched at Wölpensand, where Queen Hilde had
had a minster built, and the bones of those who fell in the old
fight buried; and there the heroes gave solemn thanks for their
great victory. Ortrûn sat alone in the churchyard, looking at
the graves: she thought of her slain father, and wished that she
too were at rest. But Gudrûn coming up to her, took her by
the hand and led her to the Moorish king Siegfried, who desired
to gain her love. During the remainder of the voyage, Gudrûn
managed to throw the two much together, and delighted in
telling Ortrûn of Siegfried’s noble and warlike deeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime Queen Hilde, and Hergart, Herwig’s sister,
often sat together at a window overlooking the sea. The Hegeling
army must soon return, but how would it return? and would
Gudrûn have kept her troth? Hilde was not so hopeful as her
young companion, for she was more used to sorrow. One day
when they were at the window as usual, Hergart saw the fleet
appear in the distance, and uttering a cry of joy, told Queen
Hilde that their friends were coming back.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_346' id='Page_346'>346</a></span>
Before the queen and her ladies could get down to the shore,
Wate had already landed. On seeing the queen, he at once
told her the good news.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest of the ships were not long in arriving, and soon Hilde
had the pleasure of embracing her daughter, the long-lost Gudrûn.
Time passed on, and joy reigned in every breast but one. Hartmut
ate out his soul in sadness. Gentle Hergart pitied him, and
begged Queen Hilde to use her influence to have him set at liberty,
and allowed to return to his kingdom. But Hilde explained how
impossible it was to let a man go free who was sure to bear
them deadly enmity, and attack them when he could. Hartmut
one day by accident overheard Hergart pleading for him so
tenderly and so wisely that he was deeply touched. He began to
think that she was, if possible, even more beautiful than Gudrûn,
and took the first opportunity he could find of speaking to her.
It was not long before they learnt to love each other. Hartmut
told the queen about it, and asked for her consent to his marriage
with Hergart, which she at once granted, and at the same time
gave him back his sword and freedom, for the husband of sweet
Hergart could never be aught else than the friend of the Hegelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few weeks later, a great marriage feast was held, in which
four couples appeared before the altar to receive a priestly blessing
on their vows; after which they adjourned to the banqueting-hall,
where all old scores were forgiven and forgotten for the sake of
the happiness that now prevailed. Then the old minstrel, Horand,
took up his harp and sang his last song. In it he told of the
great deeds he had known; he sang of noble lives and noble
deaths, of truth and constancy; and when he ceased, there was
not a dry eye in the hall, for even the grim lord of Sturmland
was seen to dash away a tear.</p>

<h3 class='dc13 center' id='p2c4s1'>I.<br /><span class='sc'>Grendel.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >One evening while the warriors were feasting in King Hrodgar’s
hall, a minstrel was called upon to sing. He tuned
his harp, and sang of the coming of Skiöld, the son whom Odin
sent to live a human life among mortal men. He told how the
babe had been seen lying on a shield floating on the waves of the
sea, how he had been drawn ashore and carefully tended, and how
he had become a mighty king and warrior in Jutland. He sang
of Skiöld’s glorious life, of the kingdom he had left to his children
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_348' id='Page_348'>348</a></span>
and grandchildren; and last of all he sung of Hrodgar, Skiöld’s
most famous grandson, who, like him, was the patron of all
peaceful arts, the protector of all peaceful folk, and the punisher
of evil-doers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many heroes were collected round the king that night at Hirschhalle,
so called from the gigantic antlers of a royal stag, which,
carved in stone, adorned the battlements. At length the time
came for the warriors to separate for the night, and as there were
too many of them to be accommodated elsewhere, beds were made
up for them in the great hall. Two and thirty brave men lay
down to sleep on the couches spread for them; but next morning,
when the servants came to waken them, they were gone. The
room was in confusion, here and there might be seen stains of
blood, and other signs of struggle.</p>

<p class='c007'>King Hrodgar came himself as soon as he heard what had
chanced, and examined the place carefully to try and find out the
cause of the disaster. He followed the blood-stains through the
hall, and out of doors, and there, in the soft earth, he saw the
deep footprints of a giant. The whole affair was clear to him
now. He knew that the monster Grendel, who had been banished
the land by the aid of a great magician, had at length returned.
When it became known that Grendel had come back, ten warriors
offered to keep watch in the hall, and fight the giant if he tried
to come in. Next morning they were gone. They had either
been surprised in their sleep, or had not been strong enough to
withstand the monster. The Skiöldungs’ people were brave and
fearless, so twelve other heroes immediately offered their services.
Eleven of them laid themselves down to sleep in their armour,
while the twelfth, a minstrel, kept watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>At midnight the giant came, smacking his great lips, and slowly
dragging his heavy body along. The minstrel saw and heard all
that took place; but he could neither speak nor move; he was,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_349' id='Page_349'>349</a></span>
as it were, paralysed with fear, and at last sank back senseless.
Next morning, when with infinite trouble they restored him to
consciousness, he either could not, or would not, tell what he had
seen. He picked up his arms and his harp, pointed to the
stains on the floor, and strode down to the strand without a word
or sign of farewell to any one. A vessel was on the point of
sailing for Gothland, so he went on board, and had soon left the
ill-fated shores of Jutland behind.</p>
</div>

<h3 id='p2c4s2' class='c020'>II. <span class='sc'>Beowulf, the Bold Diver.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Hygelak, a brave and heroic man, ruled over Gothland at this
time. He was surrounded by a band of famous warriors, chief
among whom was his nephew Beowulf (bee-hunter, <i>i.e.</i>, woodpecker),
son of Ektheov. When the harper arrived in Gothland, he
found that the Swedes had invaded the country, and a great battle
was about to take place. A few days later the battle was fought,
and would have gone badly with the Goths had it not been for
the almost superhuman prowess displayed by Beowulf, who, in spite
of repeated disaster, always returned to the charge. His coolness
and courage kept up the spirits of his men, and at last the Swedes
had to return to their own land, mourning the loss of their king,
and of many a valiant hero.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the feast that was given in honour of this great victory,
the stranger minstrel sang to the assembled warriors of the great
deeds of past and present times. He sang of Siegmund (Siegfried)
the brave Wölsung, and of all his adventures with giants and
dragons. Then, striking yet louder chords upon his harp, he
sang of Beowulf’s victory, and called upon him to do yet greater
things, to seek out and slay the horrible fiend of the fen, Grendel,
who nightly crept into the Skiöldungs’ hall, and fed on the blood
of heroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beowulf promised to go and try to slay the monster that had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_350' id='Page_350'>350</a></span>
done such incredible mischief. Now one of the great lords, Breka
by name, was envious of Beowulf’s fame, and proposed that they
two should on the morrow go down to the sea, and fight the
monsters of the deep. They would then see which of them was
the better man; and the one that reached the shore first after the
battle was over should receive the prize of victory. It was agreed
that this trial of strength should take place on the morrow, and
King Hygelak promised to give the gold chain he wore round his
neck to whichever was the victor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning the sun rose red in the east, the stormy sea
moaned, groaned, and dashed upon the shore, as though demanding
a human sacrifice. The two bold swimmers stood on the strand,
arrayed in their shirts of mail, their swords in their hands. When
the signal was given, they flung themselves into the raging sea,
and were soon lost to sight. They kept close together, that they
might come to each other’s help if hard pressed by the monsters
of the deep, but were at length parted by waves which bore
them in different directions. Breka soon after found himself in
calm water, where he swam about until it was time to return.
Beowulf, on the contrary, was carried to a place where the waves
beat fiercely against great cliffs that towered above the water, a
place that swarmed with polypi, sea-dragons, and horrible nixies,
all lying in wait for their prey. Gigantic arms were stretched out
to grasp him, but he cut them down with his sword. Monsters
of every sort tried to clutch and stifle him, but he stabbed them
through their scales. A nixie clasped him in his arms, and would
have dragged him down to his cave, but he stabbed the monster
to the heart, and drew him to the surface of the water. After a
long struggle he again reached the open sea, and then strove with
all his might to get home before the sun should quite have set.
The storm was over, so that there was the less danger. Breka
was the first of the bold swimmers to reach the shore. He turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_351' id='Page_351'>351</a></span>
with a triumphant smile to greet Beowulf, but what was his
astonishment, and that of all present, when the hero dragged the
monstrous form of the nixie on the sands, and stretched it out
before them. The princes crowded round the hideous creature,
and gazed at his enormous limbs in speechless amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here is the gold chain,” said the king to Breka. “You have
won it by hard labour; but my bold nephew has done even more
than you, in that he has conquered and slain one of the monsters
of the deep. I shall therefore give him my good sword Nägling
with the golden hilt, and the Runic letters engraved in gold,
that are sure to bring good fortune to the possessor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Beowulf was held in high honour by the Goths; but he could
not sit still, satisfied with what he had already done. He longed
to free the royal palace of the Skiöldungs from the monster
Grendel, so he presently took ship for King Hrodgar’s castle,
accompanied by the minstrel, and fifteen noble and courageous
Goths.</p>

<p class='c007'>On their ship touching the strand below the fortress, the watchman
asked them who they were, and what brought them to King
Hrodgar’s land. When he learnt their names and business, he
was pleased, and sent them on to the king. Hrodgar also received
them with joy and gratitude. The minstrel tuned his
harp and sang of Beowulf’s heroic deeds, and prophesied that he
would conquer and slay the monster of the morass. This praise
made Hunford, one of the courtiers, angry and jealous. He said
it was Breka, not Beowulf, that had won the golden chain; that
the Gothic hero was undertaking an enterprise that would very
likely lead him to his death; and he advised him to think twice
before attacking Grendel. Upon this, Beowulf exclaimed indignantly
that he had won a good sword instead of the golden chain,
and that it was sharp enough both to pierce the hide of the monster
and to cut out a slanderous tongue. Hrodgar bade the courtier
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_352' id='Page_352'>352</a></span>
be silent, and promised the Goth that if he were victorious, he
would give him rich presents, and would enter into a firm alliance
with his people.</p>

<p class='c007'>At night-fall Hrodgar and his warriors withdrew, and serving-men
came into the hall to make up beds for the strangers.
Beowulf felt so confident of victory, that he laid aside his helmet
and shirt of mail, and then gave his sword to the groom in
attendance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I intend to master Grendel with my fists,” he said; “he is
unarmed, and I will meet him in like fashion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Midnight came, and the fiend of the fen rose out of his hiding-place.
He expected a feast that night, and, wrapping himself in
a veil of mist, made his way to the palace. He entered the
banqueting-hall, and, at sight of the Goths, a grin of satisfaction
spread over his countenance, displaying his great teeth, which
resembled boar’s tusks in size and shape. At the same time he
stretched out his hairy hands, which were furnished with claws
like those of an eagle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warriors were all sunk in a sleep so profound as to seem
like enchantment. Beowulf alone remained awake, and that only
by a mighty effort. He watched the monster through his half-closed
eyes, and saw him stand gloating over his intended victims,
uncertain with whom to commence. At last he seemed to have
made up his mind, for he hurled himself upon one of the sleepers,
whom he rapidly slew, drinking his blood with evident eagerness
and enjoyment. He turned next to Beowulf. But the hero
seized his outstretched arm in such a firm grip that he bellowed
with pain. And now began a terrible struggle between the man
and the demon. The hall trembled to its foundation, and threatened
every instant to fall in ruins. The sleepers awoke. They
drew their swords and fell upon the monster; but their weapons
glanced harmlessly off his scaly hide, and they were fain to take
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_353' id='Page_353'>353</a></span>
refuge in out-of-the-way corners, that they might not be trampled
under foot by the wrestlers. At length Grendel had to acknowledge
Beowulf’s mastery, and now only strove to escape. With
a mighty effort he succeeded in freeing himself from the hero’s
grasp, but at the price of one of his arms, which, torn out at the
socket, remained in his antagonist’s hands. Then, with a howl of
rage and pain, the demon fled back to his morass, leaving a trail
of blood to mark the path by which he had gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gothic hero stood in the middle of the vast hall, holding
his trophy in his right hand. The rays of the rising sun streamed
in at the window and lighted up his head as with a glory. His
companions crowded round him and greeted him with awe and
reverence. Then he fastened the trophy of his victory over the
door of the hall, and, having done this, he returned thanks to
All-father for having given him strength to withstand the monster.
The warriors knelt round him and joined him in his praise
and thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Goths rose from their knees, they saw the king and
his courtiers assembled in the hall, gazing in astonishment, now
at them, and now at the monster’s arm over the doorway. They
told Hrodgar all that had happened during the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king was at first too much amazed to speak, but recovering
himself, he desired his nephew, Hrodulf, to bring the gifts he had
prepared to reward the victor. The warrior soon returned with
some servants bearing the presents, which Hrodgar gave to
Beowulf with many words of gratitude for the service he had done
him and the country. He then prayed the Goth to stand his
friend and his son’s friend as long as they all should live.</p>

<p class='c007'>After these things the king ordered a great feast to be prepared
in honour of the last night’s work. While this was being done,
Hunford came forward and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Noble Beowulf, I wronged you yesterday evening by my scornful
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_354' id='Page_354'>354</a></span>
speech, which I never would have made had I known what you
were. Will you accept my sword Hrunting? it was made by
dwarfs, and the blade was hardened in dragon’s blood, and, in
taking it, will you grant me your forgiveness and friendship?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two heroes shook hands in token of their reconciliation,
and went together to the feast.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the feast was over, and the warriors sat over their wine-cups,
the minstrel sang of Beowulf’s victory over Grendel, and of
the alliance which had that day been concluded between the Goths
and the Skiöldungs. When the song was finished, Queen Walchtheov
filled the goblets of all present. To Beowulf she presented
a golden cup, telling him to keep it in remembrance of her, together
with a ring and a necklace that she put in his hand, saying
they were the same that Hama (Heime) in the olden time stole
from the Brosing (Harlung?) treasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wear them,” she added, “for our sakes, but also for your own,
that you may come whole and victorious out of all the battles you
will have to fight during a long life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Beowulf thanked the queen in seemly fashion, and then the
Lady Walchtheov retired.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the king and his men, and Beowulf and his friends,
retired to the royal apartments, beds were spread in the hall for
many warriors, who, no longer fearing a one-armed Grendel,
had now flocked to the palace and filled it to overflowing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night, however, was not to pass as quietly as was hoped.</p>

<h3 id='p2c4s3' class='c020'>III. <span class='sc'>The She-wolf of the Sea.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>At midnight a great column of water rose in the midst of the
sea, and out of it came a gigantic woman, whose face was as grey
as her garments. Her eyes shone like coals of fire, her bristly
hair stood up on end, and her long bony arms were stretched out
as though in search for prey. It was Grendel’s mother, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_355' id='Page_355'>355</a></span>
come to avenge her son. She came up out of the sea, crossed the
morass, and entered the great hall; there she slew one warrior
after another, in spite of their resistance, and slaked her thirst
with their warm blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Deep was the sorrow of both king and people next day when
they heard of the new misery that had come upon the land.
Then Beowulf said that the cause of all this wretchedness was
Grendel’s mother, and that she would never cease to persecute
the Skiöldungs as long as she lived. The only thing to be done
was to seek her out in her own place, and there to slay her. This
he was prepared to do. He begged Hrodgar to send the treasures
that he and the queen had given him to his uncle Hygelak,
king of Gothland, should he fall in his struggle with the giantess.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole party then went down to the shore, and Beowulf,
wading into the sea, sought to find the road leading to the monster’s
dwelling. Finding that it was a longer way than he had
imagined, he came back to the shore and took leave of his friends,
who one and all entreated him to give up the enterprise; but in
vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait for me two days and nights,” he said, “and if I do not
then return, you may know that I have been conquered by the
mer-woman; but that is a matter that is in the hands of the gods
alone in whom I trust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus spoken, the hero tore himself away from his weeping
friends, and plunged into the raging sea with all his armour
on, and with Hunford’s good sword at his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>He swam a long way. At last he saw a light deep down in
the water. “Her dwelling must be here,” he thought; “may
the gods have me in their keeping!” He dived down, down,
down to the bottom of the sea. Many a monster of strange
shape snapped at him as he shot past, but his coat of mail was
proof against their teeth. Suddenly he felt himself caught as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_356' id='Page_356'>356</a></span>
though with hooks, and dragged along so swiftly that he could
scarcely breathe. In another moment he found himself in the
crystal hall of a submarine palace, and face to face with the
antagonist he had sought.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then began a terrible struggle. Beowulf and the giantess
wrestled together for life and death. The walls of the palace
shook so that they threatened to fall. The two wrestlers fell to
the ground, Beowulf the undermost. The mer-woman pulled out
a sharp knife to cut his throat, but Wieland’s armour was too well
made to give way, and Beowulf struggled to his feet again. The
giantess then drew a monstrous sword, so heavy that few mortal
men could have wielded it; but, before she could use it, Beowulf
made an unexpected spring upon her, and wrenched the sword
out of her hand. He clutched it firmly in both hands, and,
swinging it with all his strength, cut off the woman’s head. He
felt so exhausted with his labours that he rested awhile, leaning
on his sword. After a few minutes he looked about him, and
saw Grendel lying dead on a couch of sea-weed. He cut off his
head, meaning to take it with him as a sign of victory; but no
sooner had he done so than the blood began to flow from the
monster’s body in a great gurgling stream, then it mixed with
that of his mother, and flowed out of the entrance door into the
sea. The blade of the giantess’ sword melted in it, and vanished
as completely as ice in the rays of the sun. The golden hilt of
the sword and Grendel’s head were the only booty that Beowulf
brought with him out of the depths of the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>His friends were collected on the shore, their hearts filled with
a deadly anxiety, for they had seen the sea reddened with blood,
and knew not whose it was. So when the hero appeared, they
received him with acclamation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hrodgar and his people could find no words that would fitly
express their gratitude to the hero who had saved the land from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_357' id='Page_357'>357</a></span>
two such foes as Grendel and his mother; and when Beowulf and
his warriors set out on their journey home, they were laden with
blessings and gifts of all kinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hygelak received his nephew with great delight, and listened to
the tale of his adventures in speechless amazement and ecstasy.</p>

<h3 id='p2c4s4' class='c020'>IV. <span class='sc'>Beowulf is made King.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>Many years passed away in peace and quiet. At last the
Frisians made a viking raid on Gothland, burning defenceless
granges and cottages. Before King Hygelak could reach the
place of their depredation, and offer them battle, they had taken
to their ships again, and were far away. The king determined
to make a descent upon Friesland and punish the marauders; he
would not listen to Beowulf when he advised him to delay till
better preparations could be made for the onslaught.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Goths landed in Friesland without opposition, and,
marching into the country, revenged themselves by burning many
a farmstead, and taking many a castle and township. Now
the Frisians were a free and warlike people, whose heroes had
played an honourable part in the great Bravalla-fight; the time
had come for them to preserve their homes and liberty, and they
did not shun to make ready for battle. A murderous engagement
took place between them and their Gothic invaders, in which the
latter were defeated, and obliged to fly to their ships, terror-stricken
by the loss of their king. Beowulf and the noblest of
the warriors alone stood their ground, and, although severely
wounded, did not join in the retreat until they had rescued and
carried off Hygelak’s body. Then the conquered army set sail
for Gothland.</p>

<p class='c007'>Queen Hygd was at first so overwhelmed with sorrow for the
loss of her husband that she could give no thought to matters of
state; but after a time she roused herself from her grief, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_358' id='Page_358'>358</a></span>
began to consider what was best for the nation. It was well that
she did so, for while she was still wrapped up in her sorrow, the
barons had been quarrelling among themselves, and creating
much disturbance. The royal widow therefore called a meeting
of the notables, and standing up before the assembly, spoke of the
anarchy into which the country was falling, and said that as her
son Hardred was too young to govern the kingdom, and preserve
it from civil or foreign war, she strongly advised that Beowulf
should be made king. The notables all cheered, and shouted that
Beowulf should be their king; but the hero came forward and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“And do you really think, ye men of Gothland, that I would
rob the child of my uncle and friend of his rights and honours?
May the gods, the avengers of all evil, preserve me from such a
crime! Here,” he cried, lifting young Hardred on his shield,
and holding him aloft, “here is our king. I will be his faithful
guardian, and will act in his name till he is old enough and wise
enough to take the reins of government into his own hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nobody ventured to remonstrate with Beowulf; indeed, they all
knew that remonstrance would be in vain. And so the matter
was settled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Years passed on, and Beowulf kept his word. He ruled the
kingdom with a strong hand, and with absolute justice; and with
the help of Queen Hygd educated the young king with so much
wisdom, that when the sovereign power was placed in his hands,
there was every hope that he would use it for his people’s good.
But Hardred was not long to rule over the Goths. Like his
former guardian and teacher Beowulf, the king was of a frank and
honest nature, and trustful of all who had not shown themselves
his enemies. So when Eanmund and Eadgils, the sons of Ohtere,
king of Swithiod, came to him as fugitives, he received them with
all kindness. He often tried to make them see that they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_359' id='Page_359'>359</a></span>
been wrong in rebelling against their father, and offered to
arrange matters with him on their behalf. One day, when he
was speaking to them very earnestly on this subject, Eanmund, a
passionate, hot-tempered man, told him that he was too young
to advise a tried warrior like him. Hardred sharply told him to
remember to whom he was speaking; and Eanmund, completely
losing the little self-control he ever had, drew his sword and
stabbed his royal host to the heart. Young Wichstan (Weohstan)
at once avenged the king’s murder by slaying Eanmund; but
Eadgils fled back to Swithiod, and soon after succeeded his father
on the throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gothic Allthing, the assembly of all the free men of the
nation, was called together as soon as Hardred’s murder was
made known, and by a unanimous vote Beowulf was elected king
in his cousin’s stead. He accepted the office, and swore to
rule his people justly.</p>

<h3 id='p2c4s5' class='c020'>V. <span class='sc'>The Fight with the Dragon.</span></h3>

<p class='c007'>When Hardred’s death was noised abroad, several of the neighbouring
peoples made raids upon Gothland, but Beowulf kept so
strict a watch on the borders that the enemy was beaten back at
all points. Scarcely was the country freed from the attacks of
these sea-wolves, when Eadgils, king of Swithiod, came at the
head of a large army to avenge his brother’s death. The Goths
and Swedes met, and fought a murderous battle, in which many
men were slain, and among them King Eadgils. After the death
of their king, the Swedes retired to their ships, and sailed back to
their own land. The consequence of this victory was a lasting
peace. No vikings dared attack the well-defended shores of
Gothland, and but few quarrels arose among the nobles to disturb
the internal peace of the realm. Beowulf ruled the land with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_360' id='Page_360'>360</a></span>
great justice and wisdom. No one entreating his help was ever
sent empty away, and no act of tyranny remained unpunished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Forty years or more passed after this fashion. The hero had
grown an old man, and hoped that the national peace and happiness
would last as long as he lived. But he was to be rudely
awakened from this dream. An enemy attacked Gothland, against
whom all weapons and armies were useless. This was how it
happened. A dishonest slave, who feared discovery and punishment
at his master’s hands, fled from home, and took refuge in a
wild, rocky place. When he got there, he looked about for some
cave in which he might take up his abode. Coming to one, he
entered, but found it already tenanted by an immense dragon,
which lay stretched on the ground asleep. Behind it, at the back
of the cave, were treasures of all sorts. The man looked greedily
at the shining mass of jewels and gold, and thought in his heart,
“If I had but a few of these treasures, I could buy my freedom,
and need no longer fear my master.” This idea made him bold.
He slipped softly past the monster, and stole a golden pot, the
knob on whose lid was formed of a shining carbuncle. He
escaped safely, and going back to his master, bought his freedom.
Neither of the men had the slightest notion of the harm this deed
would bring down upon the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dragon, which had watched over its hoard for hundreds of
years, and knew each costly thing by heart, saw at once that it had
been robbed. At nightfall it crept out of its hole to look for
traces of the thief. Finding none, it lifted up its voice and howled
so loud, that the earth shook, at the same time flames issued from
its mouth and burnt up granges and homesteads far and wide.
The men, who sought to put out the fire, fell victims to its fury,
or else were dragged into the monster’s cave, where they perished
miserably. This happened night after night; the devastation had
no end. Many brave warriors went out against the dragon, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_361' id='Page_361'>361</a></span>
tried to kill it, but none of them could withstand the fiery blasts
with which the creature defended itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old king heard the story of these events with infinite
sorrow. He determined himself to attack the monster, and when
his friends remonstrated with him on his rashness, he replied that
it was his duty to defend his people from all their enemies, and
that the gods would help him. He further announced that he
would have fought the dragon unarmed, as he had done the monster
Grendel, the son of the sea-witch, but that he feared he could
not make his way through the flames without such protection.
He therefore had a shield made three times as thick as usual, and
so large that it covered him completely. This done, he chose
eleven of his bravest warriors to be his comrades in this adventure,
among them Wichstan, the man who avenged King Hardred’s
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beowulf and his companions set out on their journey, and in
due course arrived at the dragon’s cave, out of which there flowed
a brook whose waters were made boiling hot by the monster’s
fiery breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king bade his friends wait a little way off, until they
saw whether he needed their help, and then advancing to the
mouth of the cave, he called the dragon to come forth. The
great beast came out at his call, and a terrible struggle ensued.
Both combatants were hidden from view in a dense cloud of
smoke and fire. The rocks trembled and shook at the bellowing
of the monster, which at the same time slashed out with its
tail, whose blows fell like a sledge-hammer both in sound and
regularity. For a moment the smoke and flames were blown
aside by a puff of wind, and Beowulf’s comrades saw that the
dragon had just seized their king in its great jaws. They could
not bear the sight, and ten of them slipped aside and strove to
hide behind rocks and trees; but the eleventh, brave Wichstan,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_362' id='Page_362'>362</a></span>
hastened to help his master. His shield was burnt up in a
twinkling, and he was obliged to seek shelter behind the king.
Both heroes seemed lost. The dragon tore down Beowulf’s iron
shield, and caught him a second time in its great jaws, crushing
him between its teeth with such force, that the iron rings of
his coat of mail cracked like so much crockery, though they
had been forged by Wieland himself. Then Wichstan seized his
opportunity, when the beast’s head was raised, the better to
champ his prey, and plunged his sword into the fleshy part of
its throat under the lower jaw. Upon this the dragon dropped
the king, and encircled both its adversaries with its tail, but
Beowulf at the same moment made a lunge at its open mouth,
driving his weapon so deep that the point came out at the
dragon’s throat. After that they soon dispatched the monster,
and then threw themselves on a ledge of rock, panting and
exhausted.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they had recovered a little, the heroes loosened their
armour, and Wichstan saw that blood was oozing slowly from
under the king’s gorget. He wanted to bind up the slight
wound; but Beowulf forbade him, saying that it would be
useless, as the hurt had been given by the dragon’s tooth, and
the poison was already in his veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must die,” he added, “but I go to my forefathers without
sadness, though I am the last of my race, for my wife has
given me no son and heir. I can look back on my past life
with pleasure, for I have wronged no man, but have shown
justice to all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then asked Wichstan to fetch him a drink of water, and
afterwards to bring him the treasure out of the dragon’s cave,
that he might see, with his own eyes, the last gift he should
ever make to his people.</p>

<p class='c007'>His commands were obeyed, and a few minutes later he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_363' id='Page_363'>363</a></span>
passed away quietly and peacefully. Wichstan gazed at him in
silent grief. Beowulf had been his dearest friend, and he felt
that, with his death, his last tie to life was loosed. Meanwhile
the ten warriors had come out of their hiding-places, when they
found that all danger was over. On seeing what had chanced,
they raised their voices in mourning; but Wichstan bade them
hold their peace, or if they must weep, at least to weep for
their own cowardice, and not for the hero who had died at his
post. He then advised them to make the best of their way to
other lands, as he could not answer for their lives when the
Goths became aware of the way in which they had deserted their
king in his hour of need.</p>

<p>BEOWULF DYING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With bowed heads and shame-stricken faces the men turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_364' id='Page_364'>364</a></span>
away. They departed out of Gothland, and sought to hide their
heads in countries where their names were unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body of Beowulf was borne to its funeral pile on the
height called Hronesnäs, and there burnt amid the tears and
sorrow of a nation. When the funeral rites had all been performed,
the great treasure was taken back to the dragon’s cave.
For the Goths would have none of the gold their beloved king
had won for them in his death. So it still lies hidden in the
heart of the earth as in the olden time when the dragon
guarded it from mortal ken. If it is useless to men, it is at all
events not hurtful.</p>

    <span class='sc'>The CHILDREN of HAYMON.</span></h3>

    <p class='center'><span class='sc'>Haymon.</span></p>

<p class="dc14">Safe and victorious, Karl the
Great (Charlemagne), king of
the Franks, had returned from Hungary. He had conquered
the wild Avars, destroyed their strongholds, and come back to
Paris with much booty.</p>
<p class='c007'>High festival was being held in the royal palace, for the king
was busied dividing the newly conquered country into counties
and baronies amongst those of his warriors whom he thought
best fitted for such responsible charge. While thus employed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_368' id='Page_368'>368</a></span>
Lord Hug of Dordone came forward, and asked the king if
he had forgotten the faithful services rendered him by Count
Haymon of Dordone, that he had not mentioned his appointment
to any of the new fiefs. Karl at once replied, that he had
not forgotten Haymon, but he considered that bold warrior had
already fiefs enough and to spare. Indeed, if he gave him
more, it would only make him think himself as powerful as his
master, and might even tempt him to throw off his allegiance
to the Frankish crown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a faithful vassal, sire,” answered Hug, “as true as a
sword to its sheath; but if he is given a lower position than
meaner men, he may in good truth forget his oath of allegiance,
and fight for his rights. Did he do so, he would not lack aid
from many a trusty comrade.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke, the hero touched his sword significantly. The
king’s wrath was so roused by the boldness of this speech, that
he drew his sword, and, next moment, the good lord’s head was
severed from his body at one blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The courtiers drew back in speechless horror, and Haymon,
who came in at that instant, asked one of the bystanders what had
happened. When he heard the reason of the king’s murderous
deed, he turned sharp round upon his heel, and went out without
further word or greeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as he reached his own castle, he gathered his friends
about him, and declared war against his liege lord. No great
battle was fought; but continual conflict raged between the contending
parties, the country was laid waste, and the peasantry
suffered terribly. Haymon was able to move about from place to
place with such incredible swiftness that people began to say he
rode a magic horse, gifted with the speed of lightning, and the
wit of man. The war lasted for years, till at last King Karl
came with a large army, and besieged the castle of the rebel count.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_369' id='Page_369'>369</a></span>
One morning, when matters were in this position, Haymon went
to the stables as usual with a feed of oats for his favourite horse;
but the stall was empty, the good steed Bayard was gone. Haymon
was in despair. He was just considering whether it was
worth while carrying on such a hopeless war, when his cousin
Malagis, a small, insignificant-looking man with a long beard,
came to him, and told him that he knew for certain that the
devil had carried off the horse, and had hidden it in Mount
Vulcanus, which is near the mouth of hell. He further promised
to go and fetch it, in spite of all difficulties. Then, without waiting
for a word of thanks or warning, the little man turned, and
left the count.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he got outside the castle gate, Malagis pulled a small bag
of powdered hellebore from his pocket. He sprinkled a good deal
of it in the air, and the wind carried it over the besieger’s camp.
A general fit of sneezing suddenly infected the whole army.
While the men-at-arms were thus sneezing, and calling out, “God
bless you!” to each other, Malagis quietly walked through their
lines, and pursued his journey to Mount Vulcanus.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached the foot of the great mountain in safety, and saw
smoke and flames issuing from its top. He at once went in
search of the ruler of the world of fire, greeted him courteously,
and introduced himself as a great necromancer, who had come to
offer his valuable services to his Satanic majesty. The devil
answered sarcastically, that he was accustomed to hear the
followers of the black art vaunt their powers and wisdom, but as
he was curious to see what the stranger could really do, he would
give him a chance of showing off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must know, fellow,” he continued, “that I have always
hitherto ridden on the storm-wind, but I find that too great an
exertion now. I am grown too old for that sort of thing, so I
looked out for a good horse, and managed to find one fleet enough
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_370' id='Page_370'>370</a></span>
to satisfy me. I therefore took possession of it, and brought it
here. I thought that I should now be able to ride through the
world of men more at my ease than before; but,” and here he
sighed deeply, and blue flames issued from his mouth as he did so,
“if I were not the devil myself, I should say that that horse was
an incarnation of Satan, he will not even let me mount him. I
have therefore put him into the volcano, hoping to tame him in
that manner. I have kept awake for months to look after this
work myself, but hitherto without effect. Will you take my place
while I enjoy a little nap?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well spoken, great king,” said Malagis, “but should I not be
able to watch the effect on the horse better if I were close to
it? Let me therefore beg you to withdraw the fire and smoke for
a few minutes, that I may go down into the heart of the mountain,
and enter upon my duty. Perhaps, also, the horse may be
more easily induced to obey, if he gets a breath of fresh air.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Satan consented to do as he was asked. He climbed to the top
of the mountain, accompanied by Malagis, and ordered the spirits
of the nether-world to hold back the flames. As soon as the
intense heat had cooled down, the necromancer descended into
the abyss, and took up his position near the horse. Then, as if by
accident, he threw what looked like a handful of ashes up in the
air. But it was really a sleeping-powder. In another moment
the prince of hell was sound asleep, and snoring so loud that the
mountain trembled at the sound, and ignorant men thought there
was an earthquake. Malagis now approached the horse, which
snapped and kicked at him viciously. But no sooner had he
whispered the word, “Bayard,” than the creature pricked up its
ears, and when he added, “your master, Haymon, has need of
you,” it became gentle as a lamb, and allowed him to lead it to
the upper-world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To Haymon!” cried Malagis, springing on its back; and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_371' id='Page_371'>371</a></span>
horse, neighing for joy, set off with the speed of the wind over
hill and dale, heath and morass.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the sound of the whinny, the prince of darkness awoke out
of his sleep, and at once understood what had happened. Without
loss of time, he flung himself astride of a storm-cloud, and
hurled a thunderbolt after the fugitives. But Malagis quietly
said, “Abracadabra,” at the same time holding up his crucifix.
The thunderbolt fell harmless to the ground; but Lucifer was so
much startled by the sight of the cross that he tumbled off his
cloud, and, falling to the earth, broke his leg; and from that day
forward he has had a limp in his gait.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Count Haymon was in sore distress. He was
hunted like a wild beast from place to place. His men were all
dead, or else had deserted him. He was alone and desolate.
One day, as he rode through a wood on a wretched broken-down
hack, listening bitterly to the bay of the blood-hounds, and the
hollo of the hunters who pursued him, he saw a rider gallop into
the clearing in front, and exclaimed in joy:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Malagis, cousin Malagis, and Bayard, faithful Bayard! My
misery is at an end now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Scarcely had he uttered these words when his pursuers were
upon him. He sprang on Bayard’s back, swung his sword, and
faced his foes. He and his horse fought together, and but few of
his antagonists lived to tell the tale of that day’s work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Haymon’s evil fortune now changed to good. Friends came to
his aid, and many castles and strongholds fell into his hands.
The paladins of the great king avoided giving him battle, and
the war seemed as if it might go on for ever. The proud king
longed for peace, and at last sent ambassadors to his disobedient
vassal, offering to restore all his fiefs, and to pay him four times
the weight in gold of the murdered Hug of Dordone. Count
Roland was sent at the head of the embassy. Haymon received
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_372' id='Page_372'>372</a></span>
the messengers with all honour, especially his old friend Roland;
but when he heard the terms offered by Karl, he said that the
king’s expiation for the murder must be six times the weight of
his victim, and that he must further give his sister Aya to Haymon
in marriage. These terms were at first rejected by the king,
but afterwards he consented, partly because the country needed
peace, and partly, it was said, because the fair princess Aya used
her influence with her brother to that end.</p>

<p class='c007'>So peace was at length concluded. Count Haymon was restored
to his former rank and dignity, and was married to the
princess. After the wedding, the newly married couple retired to
their castle of Pierlepont, where they lived for some time in love
and unity. But Haymon’s was too active a disposition to be content
with an idle life for long. He thirsted for glory, and to do
great deeds. So he crossed over the Pyrenees into Spain, a
country where the Christians and heathen Moors kept up a constant
internecine war. For the first few years Count Haymon
used to return home from time to time to see his wife and children,
but when the fortune of war led him further south, he stayed away
altogether, and seemed to have forgotten his beautiful home, and
all that it contained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Countess Aya mourned him as dead, and expended all her love
on her four sons, whom she educated with the greatest care, and
who rewarded her for her pains by growing up into wise and
stately men. Reinold, the youngest, and his father’s image, was
taller and stronger than his brothers, and a better swordsman than
any one about Pierlepont. He had inherited much of his father’s
quick temper; but to his mother he was always gentle and
bidable.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_373' id='Page_373'>373</a></span>
The four lads, Richard, Adelhart, Wichart, and Reinold had
already shown their prowess in the field, when a messenger came
to Pierlepont to say that Count Haymon was lying sick at an inn
at the foot of the Pyrenean hills, and near a place where hot
mineral springs were to be found. He wanted his wife to come
and nurse him. Aya prepared to obey her husband without a
moment’s delay, and set out accompanied by her sons.</p>

<p class='c007'>On her arrival at the inn, she hastened to embrace her husband,
and present her sons to him. The three elder lads embraced
their sick father tenderly, but Reinold hung back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is this broken-down old man?” he cried. “It cannot
be my father, for he is a great hero, and that man does not look
much of a warrior. I wonder if he will try a bout with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boy,” said Haymon, standing up straight, “do you not know
me for your father? Look at this ring which your mother gave
me years ago, and at these scars which I gained in battle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And,” continued the countess, “does not my love for him bear
witness that he is your father?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, mother,” cried Reinold, “I recognise him now;” and, so
saying, he clasped his father in his arms, and squeezed nearly all
the breath out of his body.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, this one is my son, and no mistake,” said Haymon. “He
was cut out of the same quarry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Aya and her sons were anxious to hear all that the count had
done and seen since they had met last, so Haymon told them all
that had befallen him, and ended by saying that he had brought
home great wealth. This wealth he intended his three elder
sons to divide equally amongst them, whilst his youngest son was
to have his good sword Flammberg and the horse Bayard, if he
could manage to ride it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reinold did not in the least doubt his powers of riding anything,
and begged his father, mother, and brothers to come and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_374' id='Page_374'>374</a></span>
see him mount his new steed. They followed the lad into the
stable. Reinold went straight up to Bayard, and seizing the halter
in one hand, was about to mount, when the horse caught his coat
between its teeth, and threw him on the ground. The bold
warrior, ashamed of his fall, sprang to his feet, and next moment
was seated in the saddle. There was a fierce struggle for mastery,
which ended in the victory of Reinold. After a wild and dangerous
ride, when Bayard once more stood in its stall, Haymon
went up to the noble animal, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bayard, this is my son, your future master.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The horse seemed to understand, for it laid its head gently
against Reinold’s breast, as though to acknowledge his mastery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Count Haymon was soon strong enough to return to Pierlepont
with his family. Shortly after his arrival there, he heard that the
king, who had lately been crowned emperor at Rome, intended
to confer the honour of knighthood on his son and heir, Prince
Ludwig, and on several squires of noble birth. Haymon and his
sons at once determined to go to court on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great tournament was held before the emperor knighted the
young men, and each and all of the candidates showed himself
worthy of the honour about to be bestowed on him; more
especially Reinold, whose prowess brought down endless acclamations.
After the ceremony of knighting the young nobles was
over, Ludwig was crowned king, and named his father’s successor
in the empire. The young king’s first act was to distribute fiefs
to the new-made knights, save and except to the brothers alone;
these he passed over entirely. He did not even invite them to
the feast, and to all appearance the day of general rejoicing was
to be a fast day for them. Reinold thought it too bad, so he
walked into the royal kitchen and helped himself to all he needed
for himself and his brothers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reason of this extraordinary conduct on Ludwig’s part
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_375' id='Page_375'>375</a></span>
was easy to guess. He was jealous of the superior strength and
prowess Reinold had displayed in the lists; above all, he could
not forget the fall he had met with at his hands. He confided
his dislike of Reinold to his favourite, Ganelon, a fawning
sycophant, and told him that he wanted to rid himself and the
country of him whom he chose to regard as his enemy. Ganelon
at once had a plan to propose. He said that Ludwig, who was
famous for his skill in playing chess, should challenge Adelhart,
one of the brothers, to play a game with him, each player to stake
his head to the other. Reinold would be sufficiently punished, in
Ganelon’s eyes, by the pain his brother’s death would cause him.
Ludwig agreed to the plan with alacrity. Adelhart, on receiving
the challenge, declined to play on such terms, saying that if he
won, he could not raise his hand against the life of his future liege
lord; but Ludwig would not listen to any excuse, saying he would
have him proclaimed a coward if he did not consent. So the
young hero gave way, much against his will.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few minutes later the two men were seated opposite each
other before a chess-board, while three of the courtiers, who had
been chosen umpires, stood beside the table and watched the
players. Five games were to be played. The chess-men on
the one side were made of gold, those on the other of silver.
Ludwig, who played with the golden chess-men, had the first
move. The five stipulated games were played one after the other,
and in each of the five, Ludwig was check-mated. The umpires
were silent. The king swept the pieces together impatiently, and
when Adelhart said he had only played for the sake of his life
and honour, that the head of his king was sacred in his eyes,
Ludwig caught up the chess-board and flung it in his face with
such force that the blood flowed from his mouth and nose, and
stained his garments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero instantly rose and withdrew. As he crossed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_376' id='Page_376'>376</a></span>
courtyard, his brother Reinold hastened to meet him, and asked
what was the matter. On learning what had taken place, the
younger brother was very angry. He gave orders that all should
be got ready for their departure, and sent a servant to tell his
father and brothers to come down to their horses. Then, turning
to Adelhart, he said he would fetch him the prize he had won.
Signing to his brother to follow him, he at once directed his
steps to the throne-room, where the emperor was seated with his
knights and nobles about him. Ludwig and the umpires were
there also. Reinold advanced to the throne, and told Karl the
whole story, asking the umpires if it were not so. Two of them
were afraid, and held their peace; but the third boldly avowed the
truth. Reinold, upon this, drew his sword Flammberg, and with
one stroke severed Ludwig’s head from his body. Almost before
the spectators could draw breath, the brothers had left the room.
On reaching the courtyard, they at once mounted their horses
and rode away, accompanied by Haymon and the rest of their
party.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were pursued on the instant. The men-at-arms came up
with them outside the town gates, and a battle ensued. From the
first there seemed to be very little chance for Count Haymon and
his sons. They had but a few men-at-arms to support them, and
the enemy’s numbers increased every minute. Their men were
at last all slain, and so were all their horses, except Bayard,
which bore bold Reinold here, there, and everywhere with equal
speed and safety. At length, seeing that further contest was
useless, Reinold called to his father and brothers to mount behind
him on Bayard. The three brothers lost no time in obeying him
but Haymon was so hemmed in by the press of people that
he could not move. Although bearing a fourfold burden, Bayard
galloped away as lightly and easily as if he had had nothing on
his back.</p>

<p>THE CHILDREN OF HAYMON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_379' id='Page_379'>379</a></span>
Haymon meantime yielded himself prisoner to Bishop Turpin,
the bishop promising that his life should be spared. But the
emperor refused to be bound by Turpin’s promise, and ordered
that Haymon should be publicly hung for the offence his son had
committed. The bishop’s entreaties were vain. It was not until
Roland and the other paladins threatened to leave his service if
he persisted in ordering Haymon’s death, that the emperor gave
way, and set his prisoner free, after making him swear to deliver
his sons into his hands on the first opportunity. With the prospect
of the gallows before his eyes, Haymon took the oath demanded
of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the brothers journeyed rapidly through the broad
lands of France. Nowhere could they find an abiding-place, for
they were outlaws, whose life was forfeited if they fell into the
emperor’s hands. At length they came to Saforet, a Moorish
chieftain, with whom they made friends, and to whom they swore
fealty. They remained with him three years, serving him well;
but when, at the expiration of that time, they asked for the pay
he had promised but never given, the Moor, who thought them
unable to defend their rights, refused to listen to the request. So
Reinold, growing impatient, cut off his head. It was certainly an
effectual way of ending the argument, but it necessitated immediate
flight on the part of the brothers. This time they turned
for protection to Iwo, prince of Tarasconia, the mightiest opponent
of Saforet. The prince received them with every mark of honour,
and with their help gained many victories over his enemies. But
when he heard of the imperial ban under which they lived, Iwo
called his council together, and asked what was to be done. Some
of his advisers wanted him to get rid of the brothers as quickly
as possible; while others said that it would be well to court the
emperor’s favour by delivering the outlaws into his hand; but the
greater number were of opinion that the best thing to do would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_380' id='Page_380'>380</a></span>
be to bind the heroes by some strong tie to the princely house.
This last piece of advice was the one followed by Iwo, who gave
Reinold his only daughter Clarissa to wife, and appointed him
and his brothers a residence by the sea. There a strong fortress
called Montalban was built, which became the chief stronghold of
the principality. On one occasion the emperor’s forces besieged
it for a whole year, and then had to withdraw, baffled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look,” cried Richard, looking down from the battlements,
“the imperial eagle flutters away into the forest with a broken
wing. Up, Reinold, and after it, that we may send it home like a
plucked goose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have something else to do,” answered his brother thoughtfully.
“Seven years have passed over our heads since we saw our good
mother. The longing to see her again gnaws at my heart; I
must go and visit her, were it to cost me my life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His brothers agreed to go with him; so they armed themselves
cap-a-pie, drew long grey pilgrims’ dresses over their armour, and
set out for Castle Pierlepont. They got there safely, and were
received with the greatest joy by their mother, who could not do
enough to show them how happy their coming had made her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chamberlain who had taken them into the presence of the
Countess Aya, soon discovered who they were, and determined to
betray them. He went at once to his lord, Count Haymon, told
him who the supposed pilgrims were, and reminded him of his oath
to the emperor. Haymon was very angry, and felt inclined to slay
the chamberlain there and then, but refrained. After taking counsel
with himself, he made up his mind that the best thing he
could do would be to take his sons prisoner, and march them off
to the emperor; giving them, however, an opportunity of slipping
away before they reached Paris. So he called his men-at-arms to
follow him, and went to his wife’s apartments. Aya, seeing them
crossing the court, would have hidden her sons, but they refused to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_381' id='Page_381'>381</a></span>
hide, and, throwing off their pilgrims’ robes, prepared to defend
their lives to the last. Reinold’s great strength served him in good
stead. He fought so furiously that the men-at-arms fell back.
Haymon alone stood firm. Reinold swung his sword, but his
mother clung to him, entreating him to remember that it was his
father who stood before him. Reinold at once put up his sword,
but disarmed his father, and took him prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The man that would have delivered his own children up to
the executioner’s axe shall go to his friend the emperor in a guise
that befits his knightly character,” said Reinold.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men-at-arms stood so much in awe of the young man’s
prowess and strong arm, that they promised implicit obedience.
Reinold, therefore, sent one of them to fetch an ass. When it was
brought he placed the count upon it, and bound him to the saddle.
Then calling a boy, he placed the reins in his hands, and bade him
lead the prisoner to Paris. The count, however, had not so far to
go, after all; for, meeting some of the imperial troops on the way,
he was set at liberty, mounted on a horse, and taken back to
Pierlepont.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brothers were enjoying themselves in their old home, when
the emperor’s troops arrived before the gates of the castle. Reinold
was alone with his mother when the order to surrender was given
by the invaders. The young man snatched up his sword, but his
mother silently pointed to the gates, which were already thrown
open. She then dressed him hastily in his pilgrim’s robes, and led
him out of the castle by a secret door. Having done this, Aya
returned to seek, and, if it might be, save her other sons; but
she found them prisoners and bound, and in the hands of their
enemies. She wept and wrung her hands, for she knew that she
was powerless to help them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime Reinold was hastening back to Montalban as quickly
as he could. He was determined to save his brothers, and knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_382' id='Page_382'>382</a></span>
that delay would be fatal. Arrived at home, he went straight to the
stables, where Bayard whinnied with joy to see him. After eating
a few mouthfuls of food hastily, he mounted his gallant steed and
started for Paris, as swiftly as if his horse had had wings.</p>

<p class='c007'>He halted in a thick wood near the town, dismounted, and
while his horse grazed beside him, threw himself down at the foot
of a great tree, and began to consider what would be his best plan
of operation. Overmastered by fatigue, he presently fell asleep,
and dreamt that a necromancer was stealing his horse. When he
awoke he looked about him anxiously, and called “Bayard,” but
in vain. He called louder and louder. No answer was returned.
He looked carefully for marks of his horse’s feet, but found none.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the edge of the wood, he met a pilgrim, who spoke to him
humbly. After some conversation, the pilgrim pushed back his
hood, and looked at Reinold with a smile, and the young man
recognised his cousin Malagis. The necromancer then promised
to restore the brothers and Bayard safe and sound. He took
some yellow powder out of a box, and sprinkled it over himself
and Reinold, at the same time muttering his Abracadabra, and
in a moment they were changed into the likeness of crippled
beggars. Together they limped into Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>A crowd of richly-dressed lords and ladies were crossing the
bridge over the Seine, which at that time connected the island-city
with the mainland. The emperor was there also, and beside
him was the famous hero Roland, to whom he had promised the
horse Bayard, if he would fight and conquer the sons of Haymon.
The horse was led by several grooms. All at once it stopped
short, whinnied, jerked the reins out of the grooms’ hands, and
trotted up to the two beggars, who were watching the procession.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bayard is strangely constituted,” cried Count Roland; “the
beast seems actually to like poor folk better than noble knights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bayard! Is this Bayard?” asked one of the beggars. “Oh,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_383' id='Page_383'>383</a></span>
noble gentleman, if this be Bayard, pray permit my poor comrade
to mount him. A holy man told us that if he did so, he would at
once be cured, and, as you see, he is a lamester.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Cousin Roland,” said the emperor, “help the poor fellow
up, that we may see a miracle for once in our lives. I only hope
it <em>will</em> be a miracle, and that the miserable wretch’s arms and legs
may not be broken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland signed to his servants, who with much difficulty hoisted
the ragged lamester into the saddle. They had to do it three
times before he was safely settled. No sooner was he firmly seated
than he drew himself up proudly, touched Bayard with the heel of
one of his wooden shoes, and galloped away so fast that no one
could overtake him. Malagis pretended to be much frightened
lest his comrade should meet with some injury from the runaway
horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>At midnight, a little man might have been seen creeping
along the streets of Paris, dressed in a grey coat. He kept continually
murmuring, “Ista, sista, pista, abracadabra!” And dark
clouds rose and covered the sky, making the moon and stars
grow dim. He at last reached a tall, gloomy-looking house,
before which a guard was set; but the watchmen had bent their
heads and fallen asleep at his approach. The strong oak doors
opened when he touched them with the point of his staff. He
entered, and went straight to an underground dungeon, where
three men were chained to the wall. He muttered some mysterious
words, and the chains fell from off them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rise, brothers,” he said; “your cousin Malagis is here. He
has come to save you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they rose and followed him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving Paris, the necromancer went to the sleeping
emperor, and asked him for the loan of his crown and sword.
Karl immediately gave them to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_384' id='Page_384'>384</a></span>
The emperor’s feelings next morning may be more readily
imagined than described, when he heard of the events that had
taken place during the night. He longed more than ever to have
his revenge on the sons of Haymon; but could not see how to
accomplish his desire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cunning Ganelon then said that he was sure that Iwo had his
price, and might be induced to sell the brothers to the emperor.
Karl tried the plan, and won Iwo to his side, on paying him a ton’s
weight of gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>This done, the faithless traitor went to Montalban, and said that
he brought good news from Paris; he had persuaded the emperor
to let bygones be bygones, and all would now be well if the four
brothers would only go to Falkalone unarmed, and in the garb of
penitents, and there beg forgiveness. The emperor had promised,
Iwo said, to grant them a full pardon, and to restore them to their
ancient dignities.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the brothers were about to start for Falkalone, Clarissa
entreated them to beware lest the message were a treacherous
one, adding that she knew her father would sell his own child
for gold. Reinold sternly told her she was an unnatural
daughter, and bade her hold her peace. He then rode on; but
Adelhart remained behind for a moment, and hid four swords,
which his sister-in-law handed him, under the skirts of his penitent’s
robe.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the brothers were riding on their asses up the steep and
narrow path that led to Falkalone, they were set upon by an
armed band of warriors. Adelhart divided the swords with
which Clarissa had provided him, and they defended themselves
so well, that the count of Châlons, fearful of losing more men,
determined to draw a cordon round the place where the brothers
had taken their stand, and starve them out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The four weary men sat down to rest. They looked anxiously
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_385' id='Page_385'>385</a></span>
all round to see whether help would not come. The hot day was
over, and evening coming on apace, when all at once they saw
a well-known banner on the opposite hill. It was waved by a
horseman who was galloping towards them, accompanied by a
small band of armed men. Reinold immediately recognised his
Bayard, and his cousin the necromancer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle at once began in the plain below. Before it had
lasted long, Bayard had caught sight of its master; with a loud
neigh of pleasure the noble horse broke through the enemy’s
ranks and galloped up to Reinold. Malagis dismounted, threw
his cousin the reins, and at the same time handed him his sword
Flammberg, which Clarissa had sent. Reinold flung himself into
the saddle, and rode down to the place of combat, followed by
his brothers, who had in the meantime caught some of the
riderless chargers that were flying from the field. The brothers
gained a glorious victory, and the count of Châlons only
succeeded in saving the remnant of his forces by retreating under
cover of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who told the magician? Who is the traitor?” cried the
emperor, when he heard what had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>After many conjectures had been hazarded, every one came to
the conclusion that none other than Iwo had betrayed the true
state of matters to Malagis, and one of the courtiers added that
the prince of Tarasconia had taken refuge in the monastery of
Beaurepart. Upon which the emperor said grimly, that even the
walls of the sanctuary should not protect him from his vengeance,
and immediately despatched Roland to capture Iwo, and see him
hanged.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Reinold first returned to Montalban, it was his firm
intention to punish his father-in-law’s treachery with death; but
Clarissa’s entreaties prevailed, and he promised to spare him. It
was for fear of his vengeance that Iwo had taken refuge in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_386' id='Page_386'>386</a></span>
monastery. He never thought of the emperor turning against
him. Reinold did not hide his satisfaction when he learnt that
Karl had sent to take Iwo out of the monastery, that he might
hang him at Monfaucon. But Clarissa was much troubled in
spirit when her husband told her the news.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, my baby,” she said, bending over her child, “perhaps
you will grow up to be a hero like your father, and then people
will point at you and say, ‘Yes, he is very brave, and a true hero;
but still, he is the grandson of a man who died on the gallows,’
and then you will creep away from the assembly of noble men,
and try to hide your shame in the wilderness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Reinold sat for some minutes in thoughtful silence; then
springing to his feet, he kissed his wife, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are as wise and good as one of God’s angels. The
traitor shall be saved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hastened to the stable, mounted his horse, and galloped
away to the forest of Monfaucon. There he found Iwo standing
at the gallows with the cord round his neck. Reinold knocked
down one of the executioners, cut the cord round Iwo’s neck,
exclaiming, “Be off, you rascal, lest you be hanged after all,”
and then beat back the other executioner, who would have recaptured
the prince of Tarasconia. Count Roland now came to
the rescue, but was soon forced to measure his length upon the
ground, and Reinold rode away, saying, “It was your horse’s
fault, good cousin, not yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Several of the paladins, who had witnessed the short combat
between the heroes, began to make jesting remarks about what
had occurred. Roland had never been unhorsed before, except
once or twice by Oliver, and he took the matter grievously to
heart. He rode away in silence; not to Paris, but in the direction
of Montalban, that he might seek vengeance for his overthrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he was riding through a wood, he met a man with a crossbow,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_387' id='Page_387'>387</a></span>
who was shooting a deer, and at once recognised him to be
Richard, Reinold’s brother. He took him prisoner, and in spite of
Richard’s remonstrances, and his reminders of their relationship,
took him to Paris, and delivered him to the emperor. Karl was
delighted at the lucky chance, at once condemned Richard to be
hung at Monfaucon, and asked which of his paladins would undertake
the task of seeing the sentence carried out. They all refused,
saying that hanging was not a seemly death for a knight to die.
At length Rype, a new-made knight, offered his services to the
emperor. A pious pilgrim who was present at the discussion,
begged that execution might be delayed until he had had time
to pray for the weal of the poor sinner at St. Denys.</p>

<p class='c007'>But instead of going to St. Denys, the holy man went to Montalban,
and told Reinold all that had happened, bidding him make
haste if he would arrive at Monfaucon in time to save Richards
life. Having said this, Malagis—for the pilgrim was none other
than he—went to the kitchen to ask for some food, for he was
tired and hungry after his long and arduous journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reinold, Adelhart, Wichart, and their men soon reached the
gallows at Monfaucon. There was no one there, so they stretched
themselves out on the grass and fell asleep. When Rype came
with his prisoner, they were still asleep; but Bayard, hearing
them, awoke his master with a kick. In another moment the
brothers had fallen upon the imperial troops, whom they soon put
to flight. They then set Richard free, and hung Rype with the
same rope he had brought for his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor, finding that all his former attempts to avenge
his son’s death had been in vain, determined on a new plan of
action. He called out a large army, and marched to lay siege
to Montalban.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fortress was strictly invested. The besieged ventured on
making an occasional sally on the enemy without the walls, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_388' id='Page_388'>388</a></span>
the purpose of getting provisions, etc. Much blood was shed on
either side, but nothing decisive took place. The siege went on
for years, and neither party gave way. At length the garrison of
Montalban began to feel the want of provisions, and Reinold made
up his mind to a desperate step. He broke through the besiegers’
camp and carried off a number of provision wagons. Malagis had
rendered such action possible by slipping out of the fortress unnoticed
and sprinkling some of his sleeping powder over part of
the camp. As he was about to scatter another pinch, he was
seized by the collar, and, looking round, saw that it was strong
Olivier, one of the twelve paladins, who was dragging him away.
The rough attack had knocked the powder out of the necromancer’s
hand, and it had fallen on the ground. Instead of
laying his hand on his sword, the little man caught hold of the
bag of hellebore snuff he had hidden within his garment, and
threw a pinch into Olivier’s face. The hero sneezed and sneezed,
and still he sneezed; but the more convulsively he sneezed, the
tighter he clutched his prisoner, whom he at length dragged into
the emperor’s presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A-chew! your Highness!” he said and sneezed; “I bring
you—a-chew!—the wicked-a-chew!—necromancer—a-chew!—do
with him—a-chew!—as you will.” Here such an agony of
sneezing came upon poor Olivier that he could say no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor thanked and pitied the worthy paladin, and
ordered that the magician should be bound, and guarded to
Monfaucon, where he was to be hanged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire,” whimpered Malagis, “pray let me live this one more
night, and let me have a good supper, for I have not tasted food
for the last four and twenty hours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the paladins and many other knights had entered
the royal tent. They one and all joined their entreaties to those
of the poor little man. Seeing that the emperor seemed inclined
to yield, Malagis said in a grave and solemn tone,—</p>

<p>MALAGIS CARRIES THE SLEEPING EMPEROR TO MONTALBAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_391' id='Page_391'>391</a></span>
“Your Majesty, I swear on my honour that I will not go away
from here without your own consent, nor will I go unless you
bear me company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Karl then promised to let him have the twenty-four hours’
grace, and several of the knights offered their services as guards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lords sat down to supper, and devoted their whole attention
to the good food and wine that were set before them, while
Malagis, curled up in a corner close at hand, appeared to do the
same. When supper was over, the necromancer was taken to the
place that was to serve him as prison, and the noble knights, who
had undertaken to keep watch and ward, took up their places for
the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>At midnight Malagis had recourse to his knowledge of the
black art. He made a deep magic sleep fall upon the camp, and
all within its bounds, save and except himself. Then, stepping
softly, he made his way to the emperor’s bedside, and dropped
a few drops of some medicament into Karl’s mouth, which insured
his sleep lasting for twelve good hours. After which he lifted
him up, and carried him pickaback to the castle. The great gate
was flung open at the sound of his well-known voice, and great
was the astonishment of Reinold when he saw what burden he
carried on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here is the pledge of peace,” said Malagis. “It has cost me
much hard work to bring it here. See that my labour bears fruit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor was carried to the best guest-room the castle
contained, and the Lady Clarissa did all that lay in her power
for the comfort of the great man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Karl did not awake till noon. At first he thought he must
be dreaming when he saw Reinold, Malagis, and strange servants
about him. The truth dawned upon him gradually, and a bitter
truth it was. Hunger forced him to accept the food Clarissa
brought, though he would much rather not have eaten it. Reinold
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_392' id='Page_392'>392</a></span>
tried by every means in his power to induce the emperor to
give up his plans of vengeance, and make peace with him.
But his efforts were vain. Then it occurred to him that a proud,
haughty nature, that could not be bent by harshness, was often
softened by kindness. He set Kaiser Karl at liberty, and the
emperor went away from Montalban without a word or sign
that betokened reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Reinold re-entered the castle, he found his cousin Malagis
burning boxes, bags, and all kinds of written papers. Much
surprised, he asked what he was doing, and Malagis replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am burning all that the noble art of necromancy has taught
me. I shall need these things no more, for my services are
useless to such a madman as you. I am now going away into
the wilderness to join the holy penitents, there I shall repent
with them in sackcloth and ashes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was as good as his word, for he took his departure soon
afterwards, never to return.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the emperor went back to his camp, he related all his adventures.
The paladins one and all entreated him to make peace
with the heroic brothers, but he refused, saying that his murdered
son’s blood still cried aloud for vengeance. So the castle still
remained beleaguered, and fortune seemed to have deserted the
garrison with the departure of the little necromancer. The store
of provisions grew less every day. Hunger stared the brave men
in the face. Reinold, after much consideration, thought of a way
of escape, and made all needful preparations. One evening, when
darkness had begun to set in, he took leave of his weeping wife,
and, accompanied by his brothers and a small band of determined
men, made his way cautiously and silently through the enemy’s
lines, and set out for a strong castle in the forest of Ardennes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning the emperor was told what had happened, and
he did what Reinold had expected. He at once ordered the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_393' id='Page_393'>393</a></span>
siege of Montalban to be raised, and started in pursuit of the
fugitives. He soon came up with them, but they defended themselves
so well, and took such wise measures to ensure their safety,
that they succeeded in reaching the stronghold for which they
were bound.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Death of Bayard and Reinold.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The heroes fought as bravely as ever in defence of their new
place of refuge, emboldened by the knowledge that their dear
ones at Montalban were now free; but however courageous a man
may be, hunger and disease are foes under whose attacks it is
impossible to hold out for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the time of their sorest distress, Aya went to the imperial
camp, and entreated her brother to have mercy on her children.
The emperor refused to listen to her, and harshly bade her go
out of his presence. But she returned again and again to the
charge, and at last Karl said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, listen to my offer, and let Reinold accept it if he
will. The horse Bayard, that Malagis brought up out of hell,
has done me more harm than any other creature, excepting
Reinold himself. Now I will pardon your four sons, and restore
their fiefs, if Reinold will give the brute to me, to be killed as
I think best. I give you my word as an emperor that I will
accept Bayard’s life in expiation of my son’s death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Aya returned to the castle, and showed the parchment
on which she had had the terms of the proposed treaty written
out in full, Reinold refused to give up his dearest and most
faithful friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think of your wife, your children, and your brothers—the
gallows at Monfaucon are prepared—an inscription will be placed
there that will be read by future generations: ‘He gave them all
up to die a shameful death for the sake of a dumb animal.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_394' id='Page_394'>394</a></span>
“Mother,” cried the hero, and rushing up to Bayard, he fed his
faithful friend with a last piece of bread, and, bursting into tears,
threw his arms round its slender neck. The horse whinnied softly,
and laid its head trustingly on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot do it, mother, I cannot do it,” cried Reinold. “Bayard
and I must live and die
together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, my son,” she
said; “but remember that
when all my children and
grandchildren are hanging
on the gallows, your mothers
heart will break.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother,” he answered,
in a strange, hollow voice,
“have your will. You have
conquered, but I shall not
survive it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then signed the treaty,
and Aya returned with it to
the imperial camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>A crowd was assembled
on the bridge in Paris, for
the news had gone abroad
that the famous Bayard was
to be drowned. Kaiser Karl
was there also with his paladins.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic060'>
<img src='images/i_394.jpg' alt='BAYARD’S DEATH' class='ig060' />
<p>BAYARD’S DEATH</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The noble horse was led to the middle of the bridge, with iron
weights fastened to its feet, and at a signal was suddenly pushed
over the edge, and fell with a splash into the Seine. In spite of
the weights upon its legs, it rose to the surface, once, twice, thrice.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_395' id='Page_395'>395</a></span>
“That horse is the devil incarnate,” cried the emperor furiously.
“Ha, Count Reinold, beware, its eyes are fixed on you; if you
are keeping it alive by any enchantment, it will be the worse
for you. I will tear up the treaty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a low cry of terror Aya flung her arms round her son,
drawing down his head, so that he did not see how Bayard rose a
fourth time, and then, not seeing its master’s face, sank, to rise no
more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero felt that all his happiness was gone with Bayard.
He thrust his mother aside, flung at the emperor’s feet the letters
patent entitling him to his fiefs, and breaking his sword Flammberg,
threw it into the Seine, muttering,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lie there with my Bayard, and may God forget to be gracious
to me, if I ever mount a horse or draw a sword again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he turned, and fled into the depths of the wild forest,
until at last he sank exhausted on the ground. There he remained
for two days and a night, overwhelmed and mad with
misery.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that he went home to Montalban. Meeting a pilgrim on
the way, he gave him his golden spurs and all his ready money
for his grey robes and felt hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady Clarissa wept when she heard the end of the noble horse,
for she had loved Bayard; but she wept still more bitterly, when
Reinold took leave of her for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who will teach our sons,” she cried, “to be true knights and
noble men, if you go and leave them thus?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our cousin Count Roland will do so,” he answered, “and you
will do your part, dear wife.” He kissed the tears from her eyes,
and continued: “Accept no fief from Kaiser Karl. Go with our
children to our own lands on the other side of the mountains.
The tyrant has no power there, for the lands are your own. As
for me, I am about to start on a pilgrimage to the grave of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_396' id='Page_396'>396</a></span>
our Lord, to see whether I may find forgiveness. You will never
see me again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Saying this, he tore himself away, and set out at once upon
his long and toilsome journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reinold went to the Holy Land, where he found a fierce war
raging between the Christians and Infidels. He was true to his
vow. He neither mounted a horse, nor wielded a sword; but
still he fought like a hero with an enormous club, and helped
in the taking of Jerusalem. After he had prayed at the Holy
Sepulchre, he returned to his native land; but not to his wife
and children, nor yet to his brothers, for he had died to all earthly
ties and joys. He went to Cologne, where the cathedral was
being built. There he lived a hard, ascetic life, and worked as a
labourer at the building. He did not even stop working during
the hour of rest in the middle of the day, although his wages were
only a penny a day. This conduct aroused the anger of the
stone-masons, so they rose in a body, killed him, and threw his
body into the Rhine. But the river would not keep it, the corpse
floated on the surface of the water, and was drawn to land by
some pious souls. And now several miracles were wrought upon
those who touched his body, which showed that he had been a
holy man. The emperor, hearing of the wonders that had taken
place, had the murderers tried and executed, and sent orders that
the body of the saint should be brought to Aix-la-Chapelle
(Aachen), or to Paris. No sooner was the body laid upon the
cart which was to convey it, than the vehicle moved of its own
accord, and rolled on and on, no matter how bad the roads, till it
arrived at Dortmund in Westphalia, where it stopped, that being
the spot the saint had evidently chosen as his last resting-place.
The Reinaldi-Church at Dortmund was built in his honour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Legend gives the exact date of the miracle, 7th of January,
811.</p>

<h3 id='p3c1s2' class='c020'>II. ROLAND.</h3>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Siege of Viane (Vienne).</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Kaiser Karl had not been married very long. He held
a great assembly of the notables. Count Gerhart appeared
amongst the rest, for he expected that this would be the time
chosen by the emperor to invest him with the promised fief of
Viane (Vienne in France), and perhaps also with that of Burgundy.
When he received the letters patent relating to the first of these,
he stooped, and, in fulfilment of ancient custom, would have
kissed the emperor’s foot; but he staggered, for the empress had
stuck out her foot, which he involuntarily touched with his lips
in falling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He must have drunk too much Burgundy before he would
have kissed the foot of the Lady, whose rosy mouth he formerly
disdained. Wine teaches humility,” murmured the courtiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gerhart sprang to his feet, his cheeks flushing with anger. He
waited in expectation of the second letter; but the emperor told
him that he could not have the fief of Burgundy, for the empress,
who was also the widow of the last duke, was strongly against it.
The count took his leave with a low bow, and set out for Vienne,
his heart boiling with rage. Arrived there, he called out his
troops, and sent to ask his brother, the mighty lord of Apulia,
for help against his sovereign. He knew that the emperor’s heart
would henceforth be turned against him, for was not the empress
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_398' id='Page_398'>398</a></span>
that same widowed duchess of Burgundy whose proffered love he
had rejected?</p>

<p class='c007'>The brothers took the field at the head of a great army. With
them came their younger brother Rainier, his son Olivier, a bold
warrior, and his daughter Auda, who was marvellously beautiful,
and brave as one of the Northern valkyrs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Karl besieged the stronghold on the river Rhone where they
had taken up their abode. The place seemed impregnable, for
it was defended by brave men, rocks, and river. Sometimes the
besiegers tried to take the citadel by storm, and sometimes part
of the garrison would make an attack on the enemy beneath the
walls. On such occasions, Auda would now and then accompany
her friends dressed in full armour, and would fight with the best.
Once when she had done so, she found that her opponent was
none other than strong Roland. He disarmed her without even
drawing his sword, and took her prisoner. Her brother Olivier,
seeing what had happened, at once came to the rescue. While
the heroes were engaged in single combat, Auda made good her
escape, and took refuge in the castle, where she was soon afterwards
joined by the rest of the party. The siege continued. The
Lady Auda often stood on the battlements, and helped to fling
stones on the heads of those warriors who came within reach of
their missiles. One day Roland came with the rest, and, seeing
the maiden, asked her name and parentage. When she had told
him, and he had answered by informing her that he was Count
Roland, a nephew of the emperor, he went on to say that he loved
her, and would never cease to woo her, even though it were at
the cost of his life. At this moment Olivier appeared, and flung
a spear at him, upon which Roland challenged him to single
combat on an island in the Rhone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes and their horses were ferried over the river to the
island, and there they fought. Each of the combatants displayed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_399' id='Page_399'>399</a></span>
the most heroic valour. At length, when evening was drawing
on, a fleecy cloud hovered over them, and, coming between
them, forced them apart. An angel wrapped in rosy light came
out of the cloud, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wherefore do you fight, Christian against Christian? Why
would you shed a brother’s blood? I call upon you to be reconciled
in the name of the Saviour who died upon the cross.
Be of one heart and of one mind, and turn your arms against
the adversaries of the true faith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The angel then waved a palm branch as a sign of farewell, and
vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two men exchanged a hearty shake of the hand, and sat
down to talk over matters of much moment to both of them.
Before they separated, Olivier had promised to use his influence
with his sister in Roland’s favour, and the latter had given his
word to fight no more against Vienne, and its defenders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the emperor was very fond of hunting, and used to go on
many an expedition into the neighbouring country in search of
game. On one such occasion he and his companions were attacked
and hard pressed by a party of Viennese under the leadership
of Olivier. At one moment it seemed as if Karl must lose
his life in the struggle. Olivier, seeing this, protected him with
his shield. When the combat was over, the emperor and Olivier
had some talk together, and the former was so touched and pleased
with the noble and generous disposition of the young man, that
he not only promised to make peace, but to appoint Olivier one
of his paladins, to forgive Gerhart, and to restore the fiefs he
held under him.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was great joy in Vienne and all the neighbouring country
when the news of the peace was spread abroad. Smiling faces
were everywhere to be seen, and happiest of all was perhaps Kaiser
Karl himself. A few days later a time was fixed for the public
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_400' id='Page_400'>400</a></span>
betrothal of Roland and Auda. Great preparations were made,
and all was done to make the day a joyful one.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the heroes were sitting at the feast in the royal tent,
messengers appeared from the banks of the Garonne, who brought
the sad news that the Moorish king Eigoland had come from
Africa with a large army of blacks, had fallen upon Gascony,
and laid waste the country with fire and sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is good news,” said brave Roland, “for an angel appeared
to my comrade Olivier and me, and told us to fight against the
infidel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is bad news,” answered the emperor, “for the Moor is a
great warrior, and has an immense number of black devils at
his back. Listen, noble knights, and I will tell you what
happened years ago. After the death of my father Pipin, my
step-brothers, the sons of cunning Bertha, drove me out of my
inheritance. I found refuge with the heathen king Marsilio at
Saragossa. With the help of brave Diebolt, I regained my
rights, was crowned king of the Franks at Aix (Aachen), and
emperor in Rome. One night St. James, the apostle, appeared
to me, and commanded me to free his grave, to which there was
a yearly pilgrimage, from the yoke of the infidel. I obeyed
him, and reduced the whole country as far as Galicia, where
the apostle lies buried. There I learnt that Eigoland had
come over from Africa, and had already reached Pampeluna.
I marched back at once, and met the Moorish forces near the
river Ceres. There was a terrible battle. The Africans fought
like very devils. They broke through our ranks, and defeat
seemed certain. Then the brave Milo, my brother-in-law, and
your father, nephew Roland, threw himself upon the demons at
the head of his men. They fought like heroes, and defeated
the enemy. But before the victory was quite decided, the noble
Milo fell, wounded to death. The loss on both sides was so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_401' id='Page_401'>401</a></span>
great that either party retreated on the morrow. Eigoland
returned to his African deserts; but he seems to have come
back at the head of a larger army than before, and to have
invaded our own land. We must now fight for home and faith,
for on this crisis will depend whether Christ or Machmet shall
rule the Franks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think this much is certain,” said Roland: “we shall conquer,
whether we live or die. Was not my father victorious,
though he fell at Pampeluna? The Lord would not deny him
the martyr’s crown, when he passed away on that field of blood.
Here, or there, ye Frankish men, what does it matter which?
The crown is ours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke, his eyes shone with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what is to become of me,” whispered Auda, “if you
do not return?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are the angel that shall give me the palm, either here
or there,” he answered; and before the assembled knights and
ladies he gave her the kiss of affiance.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Ganelon.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Next day they marched to meet the enemy, whom they saw
when they had at length reached the beautiful land that is
watered by the Dordone (Dordogne). The morning after their
arrival, a terrible battle took place between them and the Moors.
Roland, Olivier, Ogier, Archbishop Turpin, and the other paladins
fought like heroes, and led their men again and again against
the foe. At night-fall, and not till then, did the Moors acknowledge
themselves beaten. They fled to Pampeluna, where they
found more troops that had just arrived from Africa. Eigoland
and his men were impatient to avenge the defeat they had
sustained, and they were sure that they could do so, for they
trusted in their numbers, their skill, and their prophet.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_402' id='Page_402'>402</a></span>
Karl did not at once follow the fugitives. He waited for
reinforcements from France, and from Marsilio, who, although a
heathen, had formerly aided him. He sent messengers to him;
but soon afterwards learnt that the faithless king had murdered
them, and had joined the Moors. Then the emperor called his
heroes around him, and, telling them of the evil tidings he had
had, asked them whether they advised him to risk a battle,
when the enemy’s numbers were so overwhelming.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us go forward,” cried brave Roland; “before us lie two
objects, victory or paradise; who is it that will draw back?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest agreed with him, and the horns sounded to battle;
and a great battle took place, in which many men were slain
on either side, and each party fought with a desperate valour.
At last Eigoland fell under the sword of Roland, and then the
Moors took flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor reduced the country to obedience to his rule.
Saragossa alone held out, for there Marsilio had taken up his
station and determined to defend the town alone until the arrival
of the troops his liege lord Baligant, caliph of Babylon, had
promised to send to his aid. Karl, remembering his former
kindness, had determined to treat Marsilio with the greatest
forbearance. He therefore sent Ganelon, one of his paladins,
to offer the king terms, and they were these: Marsilio’s life
should be spared if he would be baptized, and become a vassal
of the empire. Ganelon would have liked to decline the honour
of carrying this message; but he knew the emperor too well
to dare remonstrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king received the ambassador with all kindness, listened
to his message quietly, and begged for a short time to think the
matter over, and consult his friends. Meanwhile he led Ganelon
over the palace, and showed him all his treasures. When he
saw that the sight of these things had had the desired effect on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_403' id='Page_403'>403</a></span>
the ambassador, he offered him three baggage-horse loads of gold,
three of silver, and three of costly stuffs, if he would turn the
emperor’s vengeance away from him, and save him from becoming
a Frankish vassal. Ganelon promised to do all that the heathen
wished; nay, for double the reward, he even promised to detain
a division of the Frankish army when the rest had gone away,
on the pretext of guarding the country, and then to deliver them
into Marsilio’s hands. The compact was soon concluded, and
each of the contracting parties swore to keep his share of the
bargain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marsilio, who thought little of bloodshed, did not hesitate to
hand over some of the nobles of his host as hostages for his
good faith, which therefore was not doubted. Ganelon spoke
strongly of Marsilio’s repentance for the past, and promises for
the future; and then, when he had succeeded in turning matters
as he wished, and the emperor was about to return to France
with his whole army in the belief that he now possessed a faithful
vassal in Marsilio, went on to persuade him to leave Roland
and the other paladins behind at the head of a small force to
watch the borders. His eloquence carried all before it, and what
he advised was done. He alone of all the paladins returned
to France with the emperor, while Roland and the other ten
remained with six thousand chosen warriors to guard the land
from foreign invasion.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>At Ronceval (Vale of Thorns).</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The heroes spent one quiet day after the army had gone.
On the second morning, their outposts came in to announce
the approach of a large army, so they got ready for the fight.
Roland led his forces to Ronceval, a narrow pass between two
high mountains, which he determined to defend. The Moors,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_404' id='Page_404'>404</a></span>
more than twenty thousand strong, came up with the Franks
before they had reached the end of the pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blow your horn,” said Olivier, “the emperor will hear you
and return, he cannot have got very far yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland gazed at his great horn, Olifant, which was hanging
at his side. It was made of ivory with gold inlaid, and, when
blown by one who understood how to sound it, would send its
voice for miles around.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, faithful friend,” said the hero, “I was given this horn,
and my good sword Durindart, by an angel from heaven. I
then swore only to blow the horn in case of utmost need. We
are not now in such a case; I think we are strong enough to
make these heathen bite the dust. Ha! what do I see? Look,
there is the traitor Marsilio! No doubt the faithless Ganelon
has betrayed us for much red gold, but we will fight for the good
cause. Monjoie, Saint Denys! Up, soldiers of Christ, let us
do battle for our holy Faith!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroes and their men rushed on to meet the Moorish hosts,
who withstood their furious onslaught with the greatest courage;
but after a while fell back, and fled, pursued by the Christians,
who slew all they came up with.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the heroes had recalled their little army from the pursuit,
they made their men sit down and rest. Before they had sat very
long, they were startled by a shout behind them of “Machmet!
Machmet!” and a great blowing of trumpets and beating of
drums. A larger army than that which they had already put to
flight was approaching in their rear. Marsilio was at its head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland prepared for battle. He sent Count Walter to guard a
wooded height, and then, accompanied by his brother Balduin,
brave Olivier, the bold Archbishop Turpin, and the other paladins,
advanced with his men against the foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle raged with intensest fury round the leaders. Wild
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_405' id='Page_405'>405</a></span>
cries and the clash of arms filled the air. At last Roland flew at
Marsilio, but next moment his horse was killed beneath him. He
sprang to his feet, and fought so desperately that the Moors turned
and fled. He looked round, and could see none but the dead or
dying. He raised his horn to his lips, and blew a mighty blast.
About a hundred men-at-arms appeared in answer to his call, then
came a few more, and lastly Olivier, Balduin, Archbishop Turpin,
and others of the heroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your horn has a goodly sound, and carries far, friend Roland,”
said Olivier; “the emperor must have heard it, and will return
and help us. It will be high time, in sooth; for see how the wild
Moors assemble in close order, and prepare to renew the attack.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Up, ye faithful of the Lord,” cried Roland; “close your ranks.
May Christ preserve us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero mounted an Arab horse he had caught a moment
before, and took his place at the head of his men. Soon spears
were hurtling through the air, and swords were clashing. Many a
doughty deed was done by small and great in the Christian force;
but fight as they might, the Franks were so few in number, that it
seemed as if the Moors must finally prevail. Olivier fell defending
his friend and brother-in-arms. Roland’s sword did such terrible
execution that the Moors once more retreated in fear, and the hero
was too weary to pursue them. His wounded horse fell dead beneath
him, and he, bleeding from many wounds, and feeling that
his end was near, staggered into a neighbouring gorge, and sank
upon the ground at the foot of a rock. Then, raising his eyes to
heaven, he whispered,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord, give me grace in Thy sight. Receive, if so be that Thou
hearest me, this pledge of my submission to Thy will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, he held up his gauntlet; a soft breeze passed over
his face, and an invisible hand took the gauntlet, and bore it away.
The hero then lifted his sword Durindart, and tried to break it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_406' id='Page_406'>406</a></span>
against the rock, that it might not fall into the hands of the
Moors. But the marble rock was split by the blow, while the
sword remained unharmed. He now blew his horn for the third
time. The worthy Archbishop Turpin limped up to him, then
came Balduin, Roland’s half-brother, his faithful squire Thiedrich,
and bold Walter, who had defended the height committed to his
charge until all his men were slain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Time passed slowly with the wounded men. At last they heard
the glad sound of horns blowing, and the clanking of armour.
Kaiser Karl had come back to their assistance. But before he
arrived, Roland had gone to the realms of eternal peace. His
faithful squire told the emperor, with tears in his eyes, that he had
seen one of God’s angels come to receive his master’s soul. Then
he went on to tell of Marsilio’s faithlessness, of the battles which
had that day been fought, and of the suspicion they all felt that
Ganelon had betrayed them into the hands of the Moor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were right there,” said the emperor; “the traitor deceived
me also. I wanted to return the moment I heard Count Roland’s
horn, but Ganelon dissuaded me, saying that my nephew must only
be hunting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The bodies of the Frankish soldiers were buried, while those of
the paladins who had lost their lives at Ronceval, amongst whom
were Turpin, Roland, Olivier, and Walter, were to be taken away
and embalmed for burial in France. Ganelon was at the same
time arrested and bound.</p>

<p class='c007'>These things done, the emperor marched against the Moors, who
meanwhile had been reinforced by the arrival of Caliph Baligant
of Babylon with hosts of followers. The battle between the Christian
and Moorish forces lasted two days, and was then decided
in favour of the Franks. Baligant died on the field, and Marsilio
at Saragossa. This victory gave Spain to the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor returned to France. Halt was made by the vine-clad
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_407' id='Page_407'>407</a></span>
banks of the Dordone, and the bodies of the fallen heroes
were interred at Blaive, after which the march to Paris was resumed.
There the feast of victory was held, and when it was over,
Kaiser Karl set out for Aix, where Ganelon was tried before a
jury of twelve of his peers. He was sentenced to prove his
innocence by single combat against Thiedrich, Roland’s faithful
squire. As Ganelon was much weakened by his imprisonment, he
was allowed to choose any one he liked to act as proxy for him.
He chose Pinabel, one of the most famous swordsmen of his day;
but that availed him nothing; God fought for Thiedrich, and
Pinabel was overthrown. Ganelon was then sentenced to be torn
in pieces by wild horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after this, fair Auda came to Aix in search of her betrothed.
None of the warriors had courage to tell her the truth,
so they referred her to the emperor, and he told her with tears
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dead,” she said; “Roland dead!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words she sank lifeless to the ground, so they took
her away, and buried her beside her hero in the vault at Blaive.</p>

<h3 id='p3c1s3' class='c020'>III. WILLIAM OF ORANGE.</h3>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Inheritance.</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >Count Henry of Narbonne, who was both a good man
and a hero, lived at the time when Kaiser Karl ruled over
the Franks. He was held in much esteem by the emperor, because
of his valorous deeds, and had received many fiefs in addition to
his paternal estates. After a time he withdrew to his own castle,
and, together with his wife, occupied himself with the education of
his seven sons, and several daughters. Years passed on, and the
sons all grew up to man’s estate. One day their father called
them to him, and said that he had a story to tell them, to which
they must listen attentively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must know,” he said, “that once, long ago, I sank
exhausted on the field of battle, worn with fighting, and covered
with wounds. The enemy rushed up to slay me, but a faithful
squire defended me at the risk of his own life. Just as further help
arrived, he sank severely wounded on the blooming heather beside
me. We were removed from the field, and every care and attention
was lavished on us. I got better, but he grew weaker every
day. He was not afraid to die, but he was troubled about the fate
of his little son, whom he would leave an orphan, for his wife
had died some time before. I comforted the man who had given
his life for me, by telling him that I would be a father to the boy,
and that if he grew up fit for the trust, he should be my heir,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_409' id='Page_409'>409</a></span>
whether I had children of my own or not. He is now a gallant
knight and brave warrior, and I am proud to call him my pupil.
Now, my sons, tell me, do you wish me to keep my word to my
dying preserver, or do you desire to share my estate amongst
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then one of the sons, named William, answered for the rest, and
said that they would all rather be beggars than that their father
should break his word to his faithful squire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not beggars,” cried the Countess Irmschart. “All that I
brought my husband belongs to you, and your father has already
endowed you with a priceless inheritance; namely, his piety,
his good faith both to God and man, his courage, and all the
lessons in knightliness he has given you. This is an inheritance
that cannot be taken from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my sons,” continued the count, “you may go to the
emperor’s court in the full certainty that you will get on there, if
you are true to the lessons you have learnt in your youth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young warriors followed their father’s advice. They were
well received by the emperor, at first for Count Henry’s sake, and
then for their own. They fought against the Moors when Eigoland
invaded Gascony, and helped to avenge the death of the heroes at
Ronceval. After their return from Spain, the emperor knighted
the brothers, and gave them considerable fiefs. William, who enjoyed
the special favour of his liege lord, was made governor of the
whole southern coast of France. He showed himself a vigilant
warden of the coast. Wherever any Saracens ventured to land,
there he was with his troopers to beat them back, and sometimes
even seized their ships.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the death of Kaiser Karl, surnamed the Great, his son
Ludwig succeeded him on the throne. The first action of the new
ruler was to go about the country, and see in what condition it
was. Amongst other places, he visited the castle where Count
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_410' id='Page_410'>410</a></span>
William lived with his youngest sister. Ludwig was so taken with
the maiden’s beauty and sweetness, that he fell in love with her,
and soon afterwards married her. This circumstance increased
Count William’s influence at court, and enabled him to keep up a
larger army, and do what he otherwise considered necessary for the
proper defence of the coast.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Captivity and Deliverance.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Peace lasted for a long time under the wise rule of Count
William, but, suddenly and unexpectedly, the Moors invaded the
land, under the lead of the powerful Emirs Terreman and Balikan.
King Ludwig and Count William attacked the children of the
desert, and strove to chase them from the country. After performing
many feats of valour, William was at last surrounded by the
Moors, and carried off a prisoner to Valencia by the Emir Tibalt,
whose captive he was by the fortune of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at Valencia, the count was chained up in a dark and
dismal dungeon, and placed under the charge of the emir’s wife,
Arabella, during her husband’s absence on a plundering expedition.
Before going away, Tibalt told his wife to feed the prisoner on
bread and water, and forbade her on any account to take off his
chains. He added that he hoped on his return to find him willing
to embrace the Mahommedan religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some time Arabella did as her husband had desired with the
strictest punctuality, but after a time she became curious to see
what the Frankish prisoner was like. So she made her servants
accompany her with torches to the cell. She saw that William was
a goodly man, and felt sorry for him. As for him, he never could
have imagined that an infidel could look so gentle and like an
angel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weeks passed quickly. Arabella tried to teach the count
her religion, by repeating passages of the Koran, and by entreating
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_411' id='Page_411'>411</a></span>
him to remember that he had only to become a Mahommedan, and
he would at once be free. And he, on his side, told her about
God and Christ, and explained to her the religion of mercy and
love. What he said came home to her heart. She visited him
again and again, thought over his teachings when she sat quietly
in her own room, and at last confessed that she wished to become
a Christian. She and William had by this time learnt to love each
other, so they determined to fly to King Ludwig.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the help of an old and faithful servant, Arabella hired a vessel,
set the count free, and went on board with him. The captain, on
learning that he was to steer for the coast of France, refused point-blank
to do so; and William, without an instant’s hesitation, flung
him overboard. He then threatened to slay the mate if he did
not obey him in all things, and he looked so terrible with his drawn
sword and stern face, that the crew durst not disobey him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Tibalt returned from his raid, and learnt all that had
occurred from the captain, who had swum ashore. He embarked
without loss of time, and set sail in pursuit of the runaways, but
only came within bow-shot just as William and Arabella landed
and took refuge in the citadel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tibalt vainly tried to take the place by storm, and had at
last to return to Valencia without accomplishing the object of his
voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ludwig invited Count William and Arabella to his court, where
they were received with the utmost kindness by both him and his
queen. Every one admired the Moorish lady’s beauty, and thought
her lovelier than any one about the court, even than the queen
herself. This roused the queen’s jealousy, and she began to treat
both her brother and Arabella with marked coldness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Count William and his bride went on to Avignon, where they
were married by Pope Leo, after Arabella had been received into
the Christian Church. She was given the name of Gyburg at her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_412' id='Page_412'>412</a></span>
baptism, as that was an old family name in the house of Narbonne.
Ludwig was present at the marriage, but the queen said
she was too busy to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days after this, William sent his wife home to Orange,
while he accompanied King Ludwig to Italy, with the object of
recovering Rome and the States of the Church for the banished
Pope. This they succeeded in doing after much fighting; and
when Leo was once more master of the imperial city, he showed
his gratitude to the Frankish king by crowning him emperor in
the room of his great father.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the coronation feast was over, the warriors all returned
home, and William with the rest. He and his wife lived happily at
Orange, and, as they had no children, William adopted the son of
one of his sisters who had died early, and brought him up as his
heir. The boy Vivian (or Vivianz) grew up to be a bold youth,
and showed promise of future excellence.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>More Fighting.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>As it happened, Vivian was to have a chance of winning glory
at an early age. The Moors invaded France in hordes. They
swept over Aquitaine in no time, and seemed as though they
would soon have the rule in France. Count William took leave of
his wife, and, accompanied by young Vivian and his men-at-arms,
set out to meet, and, if it might be, drive back the bold invaders.</p>

<p class='c007'>The armies met on the plain of Alischanz (Alicon). “Machmet!
Machmet!” was the cry on one side, and “Monjoie, St.
Denys!” on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle began, and raged for hours; young Vivian fought
like a hero, and then fell, mortally wounded. His men avenged
his fall. He was insensible for some time, and when he came to
himself again, he found that he was lying on the battle-field surrounded
by the bodies of the slain. He was very thirsty, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_413' id='Page_413'>413</a></span>
prayed for a drink of water. His prayer was heard. A shining
angel came down from heaven, and supported his tottering steps
to the side of a little rushing brook, where he quenched his raging
thirst. Before finally disappearing from sight, the angel said,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The good town of Orange and kind Gyburg are in danger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man fainted again when he heard these words. On
recovering his senses, he saw his uncle bending over him, and had
just strength enough to repeat the warning given him by the
angel, before he fell back dead.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/i_413.jpg' alt='WILLIAM OF ORANGE AND HIS DYING NEPHEW.' class='ig064' />
<p>WILLIAM OF ORANGE AND HIS DYING NEPHEW.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The count considered what was to be done. He had lost sight
of his men in the wild hand-to-hand conflict in which he had cut
his way through the enemy’s ranks; and then, coming upon his
nephew’s broken shield, he had followed his bloody track until he
found him. The battle was now at an end; but without men how
could he save Gyburg and Orange? His horse was so severely
wounded that he had to lead it by the rein. Without further loss
of time, he set out on his long and toilsome walk. At daybreak
he met a Moorish commander with several followers. He was at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_414' id='Page_414'>414</a></span>
once attacked by them, but with the first blow he clove the emir to
the saddle, and put his men to flight. Finding himself alone and
unobserved, he slipped the emir’s dress over his armour, and,
mounting the emir’s horse, pursued his journey to Orange. He
made his way in safety to the castle gate, which opened in time to
receive him just as the enemy had recognised the Frankish accoutrements
of his wounded war-horse, for the faithful beast had
followed him all the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The besiegers tried again and again to storm the castle, but in
vain. At last they determined to starve the garrison out. After a
time, the inmates of the castle suffered so much from want of food
that the count made up his mind to slip through the Moorish
hosts to bring back reinforcements and provisions. He made his
wife and captains swear to hold the fortress at all hazards, and
then, donning the garments he had taken from the emir, set out
on his perilous undertaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made his way through the enemy’s lines, and reached
Orleans in safety. There he was taken prisoner by the captain of
the guard, and ordered to instant death as a Moorish infidel. In
vain he assured the man that he was a Christian and a Frank; in
vain he told him his name and rank; neither the captain nor any
one else would believe him, and he was in great danger of being
torn in pieces by the excited populace. Fortunately, at that moment
the governor of the town appeared at the head of an armed
force, and, on seeing William, at once recognised him as his brother,
and took him away to his house. The count would have nothing
to eat but bread and water; he could not feast while his wife
and his men were fasting. Having rested for an hour or two, he
set out again on his way to court.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ludwig received him coldly, and his sister was still more
unkind. Indeed, the empress went so far as to say, that for aught
any one knew, the Moorish woman might have sent for those
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_415' id='Page_415'>415</a></span>
Saracens; she might be tired of France and Christianity, and want
to return to her own people. Ludwig showed himself unwilling
to call out his troops, saying that William was strong enough to
help himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day after day passed, and nothing was done. Meanwhile the
rumour spread that the count of Orange had come to court to
ask for help against the Moors; and the aged count of Narbonne,
his six sons, and many noble knights came to offer their help in
the good work. When they heard how ill William had fared at
court, the lord of Narbonne went to the emperor, and warned
him that if he did not support his vassals in their need, he must
not be surprised if they threw off his suzerainty. Then, turning
to his daughter, he told her plainly what he thought of her
conduct, and threatened her with his curse if she did not forget
her foolish rancour and do her duty. This bold speaking had
such good effect, that orders were at once given to call out a great
army, which assembled in an incredibly short time.</p>

<p class='c007'>On hearing of the approach of a Frankish host, the Moors
hastened to their ships, leaving their tents and provisions behind.
These William gladly seized for the use of the imperial troops.
Life and bustle now reigned in the castle from garret to cellar,
and the cooks had hard work to provide food for so many men.
Among the scullions was a tall strong young fellow, a Moor by
birth, who had been stolen from his home, and presented by his
captors to Kaiser Ludwig. William thought from his appearance
that he must be of noble birth, but every one else regarded him as
half-witted, and called him nothing but Jack Dunderhead. While
he was at the palace, he had once had the good fortune to save
the Princess Alice from a wolf. The only reward he asked of
her was that she would keep the adventure a secret. This she
did. But when he was going to the wars with the other officers
of the royal kitchen, she sought him out and gave him a ring as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_416' id='Page_416'>416</a></span>
a farewell gift. After his arrival at Orange, William’s attention
was drawn to him; and seeing the heroic qualities of the youth,
and the masterly fashion in which he handled his quarter-staff, the
only weapon he possessed, he redeemed him from servitude, took
him to the Lady Gyburg, and desired her to provide him with
coat of mail and all the requisites of a warrior. Rennewart, for
that was his real name, was so grateful for this kindness that he
swore to be faithful to William to the death. And, as he turned
to leave the room, the countess heard him say, in a low voice:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, at length, I can show that I am of royal lineage, and
may strive to win my pearl. Ah, father Terramer, while you
have forgotten your long-lost son, he has become a Frank, and
is both able and willing to fight for his new and better country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These words revealed to Gyburg that Rennewart was her own
brother, so she called him back hastily and told him all. After
this joyful recognition, he went out in full armour, but still
bearing the long staff he had always carried for his defence. He
joined the rest of the forces and marched with them to fight the
Moors, who were awaiting them on the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battle began, and Rennewart showed himself so good a
warrior as to justify Count William’s trust to the full. He even
attacked and boarded some of the Moorish ships, freed the
Christian slaves who were attached to the oars, and, getting them
to join him, drove the Moors overboard, and, taking several of high
degree prisoners, returned to the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the prisoners taken was the Moorish commander Terramer.
Badly wounded, and broken-hearted at his utter defeat,
he was astonished at the kindness with which he was tended by
William and Gyburg, to whom he had tried to do so much harm.
But he soon made friends with them, and was then rejoiced to
see the son he had long mourned as dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days later William and Gyburg went with the victorious
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_417' id='Page_417'>417</a></span>
army to where Ludwig was staying with the court. They met
with a hearty reception, and the count of Orange was created
duke of Aquitaine, while Rennewart was given the town and
district of Nismes. The emperor then rewarded all the other
leaders for their services, and gave a great feast to the men-at-arms,
and a banquet to the nobles.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the heroes were enjoying the good things provided for
their entertainment, the empress noticed that the young hero
Rennewart sat silent and absorbed, till her daughter Alise approached
to fill his glass; then his eyes rested joyfully on her
countenance, the royal maiden blushed, and her hand trembled
so, that the wine ran over. She wondered where they could have
met before, and took the first opportunity of questioning her
sister-in-law. The Countess Gyburg told her brother’s story, and
informed the empress that Rennewart and Alise had loved each
other ever since the day when the prince, in the guise of a scullion,
saved the princess’s life. A few days afterwards the young people
were betrothed, and on the very day of their betrothal messengers
arrived bringing rich presents from the Emir Terramer to his
son.</p>

<p class='c007'>William, who was now duke of Aquitaine and count of Orange,
governed his people wisely and justly. He preserved them from
dangers without and within, and listened to all petitioners of
whatever rank with equal kindness. The Lady Gyburg helped
him in all ways that a woman might. Together they founded
churches and alms-houses, and the blessing of God was with them.
When they were both stricken in years, an angel one night
appeared to the count in a dream, and, showing him a desert
place high up in the mountains, desired him to build there a
religious house, where pious monks might live, and give shelter
to any travellers who had lost their way, and might even seek out
belated wanderers lost in the snow, and save them from a dreadful
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_418' id='Page_418'>418</a></span>
death. Next day the pious hero set out in search of the place the
angel had pointed out, and, having found it, built the monastery.
He and his wife lived on together for several years after this, doing
good to all; then they withdrew into solitary cells to prepare
for eternity. After their death so many signs and wonders were
wrought at their graves, that the people believed they must have
died saints.</p>

    <h2 id='p3c2'><i>LEGENDS OF KING ARTHUR AND THE HOLY GRAIL.</i></h2>

    <h3 id='p3c2s1'>I.<br />TITUREL.</h3>

<p class='center'><span class='sc'>His Call to the Grail.</span></p>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >At the time when the bold hero Vespasian was called away
from the siege of Jerusalem, to be made emperor of Rome,
a rich man of Cappadocia, named Parille, or as the Romans called
him, Berillus, followed in his train. He was brave in war, and wise
of counsel in times of peace, so the emperor gave him large estates
in Gaul. His virtues were inherited by his sons, grandsons, and
later descendants. One of these, Titurisone, married a noble
maiden, named Elizabel, but they had no children. The knight
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_420' id='Page_420'>420</a></span>
was much distressed at the thought that a noble and chivalrous
race should end in him. Once, when he was quite elderly, a soothsayer
came to the castle, and asked for a night’s lodging, which
was as usual granted. That evening, when he was sitting alone
with his guest, the knight began to discourse of the sorrow of his
life, and the stranger told him that he ought to make a pilgrimage
to the church of the Holy Sepulchre, and lay a crucifix of pure gold
on the altar. Titurisone followed the wise man’s advice, and he
and his wife had the pleasure of having a son born to them. As
the boy grew up, he showed rare gifts of mind, great piety, and
unusual strength. He had received the name of Titurel at his
baptism, a name that soon became known throughout the length
and breadth of the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the boy grew to man’s estate, he went with his father to
fight against the heathen. He showed such marvellous prowess,
that his father began to praise him, and prophesy great things for
his future; but the lad modestly said that he had only done his
duty like others.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the victorious army returned home, Titurel was not to
be tempted to remain at court, but hastened away to his native
place. Arrived there, he did not go first in search of his mother,
but made his way to the chapel, dressed in the robes of a penitent.
He approached the altar bare-foot, and presented the booty he
had brought from the war. Having prayed for God’s blessing on
all his undertakings, he rose from his knees, and, going into the
castle, hastened to embrace his mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Titurel sometimes took part in the crusade against the Saracens.
His gallant deeds were so numerous that they became noised
abroad, and his name was held in honour by Christians and infidels
alike.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many years passed on. Titurisone and his wife both died,
leaving a large inheritance to their only son. The change in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_421' id='Page_421'>421</a></span>
outward fortunes made no difference in Titurel—he remained as
humble in the sight of God and man as before; he had more
to give away to the poor and needy, that was the only use of
wealth in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>One beautiful spring morning he went out to walk in the wood.
Coming to a soft mossy bank, he seated himself, and looked about
him. Flowers filled the air with their perfume, birds were singing
in the trees, and a gentle breeze whispered among the fresh green
leaves. He felt full of peace and joy; it almost seemed to him
as though God were speaking to him in the songs of the birds,
the rustle of the foliage, and the murmur of the brook. The sky
was blue, one soft fleecy cloud alone was visible. He was surprised
to see it coming as if towards him with extraordinary speed,
and yet it was not driven by the wind. At last it sank to the
earth before him, and out of it came an angel, who spoke to
the hero in a deep melodious voice like the sound of the organ
in church.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hail, chosen hero of the Most High! The Lord hath called
thee to guard the holy Grail on His mountain, Montsalvatch.
Set thy house in order, and obey the voice of God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The angel stepped back, the cloud closed round him like a silver
veil, and he floated away to heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>Titurel went home in a state of ecstasy. He divided his wealth
among his servants and those who had most need of it, after which
he returned fully armed to the place where the angel had appeared
to him. Once more he saw the cloud in the sky, and this time
it was fringed with the gold of sunshine. It went before him,
showing him the way to the goal of his pilgrimage. He went on
and on through vast solitudes. At length he came to a deep dark
wood, and after that to a mountain, the sides of which seemed too
steep to climb. But the cloud preceded him, and he followed,
dragging himself up precipitous rocks, past great abysses that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_422' id='Page_422'>422</a></span>
made him dizzy to look into, and through thickets of thorn.
Often he felt so weary he could hardly drag one foot after the
other, and was tempted to despair of ever reaching the top. But
a voice seemed to speak to him encouragingly at such moments
of weakness, and he found strength to struggle on. At length he
reached the top of the mountain. He saw a bright light before
him, it was the Sangreal borne in the air by invisible hands.
Beneath it knelt a number of knights in shining armour. Seeing
him, they rose to their feet, and cried,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hail to thee, chosen hero, called to be guardian of the holy
Grail!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not answer, his eyes were fixed on the sacred vessel,
which was like a cup of emerald-coloured jasper, encircled by
a stand of chased gold. Lost in the wondrous sight, he prayed
for strength to guard what was put under his charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>And in good truth Titurel was worthy of his high calling. He,
with the help of the other knights under his command, prevented
any infidels from approaching the holy mountain. Many years
passed away, and the vessel never came down to earth. So
Titurel determined to build a castle and temple on the mountain-top
worthy to hold and protect the Sangreal.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Building of the Temple.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>When the grass, ferns, and stones were cleared away, it was
discovered that the rock, or core of the mountain, was one entire
onyx of enormous size. This was flattened into a flooring, and
polished with great care; and upon it the castle was built. Now
came the more important task of rearing the temple, but they were
in doubt as to the plan and shape that would be most fitting.</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning when Titurel awoke, he prayed that he might be
enlightened to know how to build the church, and when he went
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_423' id='Page_423'>423</a></span>
out he saw the entire ground-plan clearly marked out on the
rock-foundation, and all the miraculous materials that were wanted,
ready piled up in huge stacks. So the knights worked hard all
day long, and the invisible powers worked all night. It was
wonderful how quickly the walls rose, and the church was finished.
It was circular in form, and had seventy-two octagon choirs, every
two of which supported a belfry. In the midst rose a tower with
many windows, and openings with pointed arches. The topmost
point of the tower was a ruby, out of which rose a cross of clear
crystal surmounted by a golden eagle with outstretched wings.
Within the building, sculptured vines, roses, and lilies twined about
the pillars, forming bowers, on whose branches birds seemed to
flutter as if alive. At every intersection of the arches was a glowing
carbuncle that turned night into day; and the vaulted roof
was of blue sapphire, in which a miracle of art was to be seen. The
sun, moon, and stars placed there by the builders, moved in the
same order as the real luminaries in the heavens.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the wide inner space of the great temple a second and
smaller sanctuary was built, resembling the first, but far more
beautiful. This was the place intended for the Sangreal, should
it come down to earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now the work was finished. The hour of consecration had
come. The bells rang. The priests began to chant the hymn,
and a chorus of angels joined in: “Glory to God on high, peace
on earth, good will to men.” At the same moment a sweet perfume
filled the air, the sacred vessel descended and floated over
the altar in the inner sanctuary. A deep and solemn silence
reigned in the mighty building. Then the invisible choir began
to sing: “The glory of the Lord has arisen in Zion! Praise Him,
ye faithful, and make known His holy name.” The priest spoke
the blessing, and the consecration was complete. Titurel did not
move for some time after the others had withdrawn. He was lost
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_424' id='Page_424'>424</a></span>
in wonder and joy. He did not touch the vessel, for he had not
been told to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The building had taken thirty years to complete. After the
consecration, a dove appeared every Good Friday carrying a wafer
from the holy sacrament in its bill. It dropped the wafer into the
sacred vessel, thereby keeping up the miraculous powers of the
Grail, which provided food for the knights who guarded it, and
healed any wounds they might sustain at the hands of the unbelievers
who sometimes attacked them.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>His Marriage and Descendants.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Time passed on, and Titurel was four hundred years old, but no
one looking at him would have thought him more than forty.
One evening when he entered the sanctuary and turned his eyes
upon the Grail, he saw that it had a message for him. Drawing
near, that he might read the letters of fire in which all such
commands were issued, he read that he was to take a wife, so that
the chosen race might not die out of the land. He called the
knights of the Temple. They saw what was written, and said
that he must obey. With one accord, all fixed upon the Lady
Richoude, daughter of a Spanish chief, as the most worthy
maiden to be his wife. The wooing was done by solemn embassage,
and neither father nor daughter was deaf to the call.
The marriage took place, and on the same day Titurel received
the honour of knighthood, which he had always refused before out
of humility. Two children were born to Sir Titurel and his wife;
a son named Frimutel, and a daughter called Richoude after
her mother. Twenty years later Titurel lost his wife, and was
once more alone in the world, except for his children, to whom
he was devoted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richoude, who was very lovely, married a king whose realm
lay far away from her old home; and Frimutel married Clarissa,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_425' id='Page_425'>425</a></span>
daughter of the king of Granada; by her he had five children.
Two of them were sons, Amfortas and Trevrezent by name, and
three daughters, Herzeleide, Joisiane, and Repanse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Titurel was no longer able to bear the weight of his armour:
he passed his time either in church or with his grandchildren.
One day when he went, as he often did, to gaze at the holy
Grail, he saw written in letters of fire on the rim of the vessel,
“Frimutel shall be king.” The old man’s heart was full of joy.
He called his son, his grandchildren, and all the young heroes who
served the Sangreal, around him, and told them what had been
ordained. He then desired his granddaughter Joisiane to place
the floating Grail upon the altar; for she, as a pure virgin, could
touch it. She obeyed, and then the old man put the crown on
his son’s head, and blessed him and the assembled brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Titurel lived on, and saw many joyful and many sorrowful
things happen. Joisiane married King Kiot of Catalonia, and
died at the birth of her babe Sigune,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Who fairer was than flowers in lusty May,</div>
      <div class='line'>That ope their dewy cups to dawning day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Her sister Herzeleide took the child, and brought it up with
Tchionatulander, the orphan son of a friend; but after a time she
lost her husband, and had to fly with her son Percival, leaving
Sigune and Tchionatulander under the care of friends. But worse
things than this were yet to happen. Frimutel thought his life at
Montsalvatch confined and dull, he wearied of it, and went out
to seek excitement in the world. He died of a lance-wound
far away in the land of the unbelievers. His son Amfortas was
crowned his successor, in obedience to the fiery letters that appeared
on the holy vessel; but he had inherited the wild blood
and roving spirit of his father; and instead of fulfilling the office
to which he was appointed, he went out into the world in search of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_426' id='Page_426'>426</a></span>
love and fame. At length he was brought back to his grandfather,
sick unto death of a wound caused by a poisoned spear.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, while Sir Titurel knelt in the sanctuary praying for
his grandson, whose life of pain was prolonged by the holy
Grail appearing to him once in every seven days, he suddenly
saw these words in letters of fire:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Murmur not, good old man; endure the load of others’ sins.
A chosen hero shall one day climb the holy mount. If he ask,
before nightfall, of the beginning and end of this tale of woe, then
shall the spell be broken, and Amfortas cured, but the new-comer
shall be king in his stead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again and again Titurel read the mysterious words, and asked
when the hero would come. He received no answer; but the
words, “murmur not; endure,” shone brighter than before, and
he bowed his head, leaving the future confidently to God.</p>

    <h3 id='p3c2s2' class='mt'>II.<br />PERCIVAL.</h3>

    <p class='center'><span class='sc'>Journey to Arthur’s Court.</span></p>

<p class='dc16'>
When Queen Herzeleide
had to fly from home
with her little son on the death
of her husband, she retired to a
small house she possessed in an out-of-the-way district, and
devoted herself to the education of her boy. She never spoke to
him of knightly deeds, for she feared lest, when he was grown
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_428' id='Page_428'>428</a></span>
up, he should leave her to seek adventures, and should die in
some tournament or feud. Notwithstanding this, young Percival
grew up a bold, strong youth, fearless of all danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, as he was coming home from hunting, he met some
knights riding through the wood arrayed in full armour. One of
them asked him a question, which Percival answered at random.
Then, going up to the knight, he asked what strange garments
those were that he and his companions wore, and why they had
golden spurs. The knight was amused, and answered the lad’s
questions very kindly, adding, “If you want to know more of
knights and knighthood, you must go to King Arthur’s court,
and there, if you are worthy, you may perchance be made a
knight yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Percival could not forget what he had heard and seen. He
cared no more for hunting, and spent his days and nights in
dreaming of swords, knighthood, and battle. Herzeleide asked
her son what ailed him, and when she learnt the cause of his
sorrow, her heart was filled with terror lest, inheriting his father’s
heroic spirit, Percival might meet with his father’s fate. At
length she gave way to the lad’s entreaties, and let him go, but
with a breaking heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Percival felt the parting with his mother very much; but
youth and hope were strong in his heart, and thoughts of the
joy of meeting again soon thrust the sorrow of parting into the
background.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lost in such reflections, he came to a meadow in which some
tents were pitched. In one of these he saw a couch on which
a beautiful woman lay asleep. She was richly dressed; her girdle
blazed with precious stones, as did also the ornaments on her
arms, neck, and fingers. He thought, as he plucked a flower,
so he might also steal a kiss from the rosy lips of the sleeping
beauty; but, as he did so, she awoke, and was very angry.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_429' id='Page_429'>429</a></span>
“Don’t be angry,” he said, throwing himself at her feet. “I
have often kissed my mother when I have caught her asleep,
and you are more beautiful than my mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady gazed at him in astonishment, and listened to his
boyish confidences about going to Arthur’s court, being made
a knight, and doing great deeds thereafter. Suddenly a horn
sounded at no great distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is my husband,” cried the lady; “quick, boy, get away
as fast as you can, or we are both undone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am not afraid,” he said. “Look at my quiver; it is
quite full; I could defend you as well as myself. Let me have
one of your bracelets as a sign that you are not angry with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke, he slipped the bracelet off her arm, left the tent,
mounted his horse, and rode away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after this Lord Orilus, the lady’s husband, appeared,
and with him many knights. When he heard from her what
had happened, he fell into a passion, and swore that he would
hang the “impudent varlet” if he could catch him. But though
he set out at once in pursuit, he could see nothing of the youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Percival continued his journey. That night he
slept in the forest, and went on his way next morning at an easy
pace. As he was passing under a rock, he saw a maiden sitting
by a spring that gushed out of it. She wept bitterly as she
bent over a dead man, whose head lay in her lap. Percival
spoke to her, and tried to comfort her by saying that he would
avenge the death of the murdered man, for murdered he was
sure he was. He then told her his name, and she said that she
was his cousin Sigune, and that the dead man was her old playfellow
Tchionatulander, who had met his end in trying to gratify
a silly wish of hers—a wish she had no sooner given utterance
to than she repented. She had lost a dog, and had wanted to
have it again. That was the cause of all her sorrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_430' id='Page_430'>430</a></span>
“He was a real hero,” she continued, “and one of the knights
of King Arthur’s Round Table. Your mother made him governor
of her wasted lands. He conquered the robber hosts, slew their
leader, wild Lahelin, and flung his ally, Orilus, Lord of Cumberland,
from his horse, so that he only escaped by the help of his
troopers who bore him off the field. When he promised to get me
back the dog, he challenged Orilus to single combat before King
Arthur and his knights, the prize of victory to be the setter that
Lord Orilus had caught, and kept, when it ran away from me.
The challenge was accepted, but the time of meeting was put off
for a while, because Orilus was suffering from an unhealed wound.
Meanwhile the Lady Jeschute, fearing for the life of her husband,
sent me back the dog. Tchionatulander and I regarded the
matter as settled, so we set out together to go to the sanctuary
of the Holy Grail, where we were to be married. As ill luck
would have it, we met Orilus and his wife, and in spite of all the
entreaties of Jeschute and myself, the two knights quarrelled and
fought. Orilus recovered from the stunning fall; but my dear
love—oh that I had died instead! It was my fault, all my
fault.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be comforted, cousin,” said Percival, “I will go to King
Arthur, I will tell him your story, and ask him to make me a
knight, and to take care of you. Then I will go and seek out
Orilus, and avenge your wrongs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then took leave of Sigune, and went on his way. Coming
to a broad river he questioned the ferryman as to where he should
find King Arthur’s court. The man answered that he must go to
Nantes, a good bit on the other side of the river; so Percival gave
him the gold bracelet he had taken from the lady’s arm, and
asked him to set him across. This the man did, and afterwards
put him in the right road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at Nantes, the first person he met was a red-haired
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_431' id='Page_431'>431</a></span>
knight clad in red armour, and riding a sorrel steed. Percival
spoke to him courteously, and asked for the loan of his horse and
armour, that he might go in seemly fashion to the king and ask
for knighthood at his hands. But the stranger laughed, and said,
“A rustic youth in a fool’s cap were the very thing to carry my
message of defiance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here,” he continued, “take this cup to the king as a token,
tell him that I challenge him and all his Round Table to deadly
combat. You see that I cannot lend you my horse and armour, as
I need them myself, but after the battle you will be able to pick
and choose amongst the armour and horses of the slain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Indignant at the knight’s refusal, Percival rode on in silence.
As he went down the principal street of the royal borough, the
people all laughed at his appearance, the very boys pointed and
hooted at him, and in good truth he looked ridiculous enough.
The ribbons of his striped cap fluttered in the breeze, his many-coloured
jacket and leather hose were very shabby, and his sorry
nag limped with fatigue. At length a squire named Iwanet took
his part, chased away the boys, and chid them for their discourtesy
to a stranger. The young hero thanked the man, and begged
him to take him to King Arthur to whom he was the bearer of
a message. Iwanet at once complied with Percival’s request, and
took him to the palace. On entering the open hall where the king
was seated with his knights at the celebrated Round Table, the
young man turned to his companion in amazement, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are there so many Arthurs? My mother only told me of
one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The squire smiled as he replied that there was indeed only one
Arthur, and that he was the knight whose beard was beginning to
turn grey, and who wore the crown on his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Percival now walked up the hall, and bowing to the king
repeated the message of the red knight, adding that he wished the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_432' id='Page_432'>432</a></span>
king would use his power and give him the red knight’s horse and
armour, for he liked them well.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The boy would have the bear-skin before the hunter has slain
the bear,” said Arthur laughing; “but,” he added, “I will give you
the things you ask for, if you can get possession of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, sire,” answered Percival, “I shall need your gift
if I am to become a knight;” so saying, he bowed, and took his
leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he returned to the red knight, he told him all that had
occurred, and asked him for the horse and armour the king had
given him. The knight upon this rapped him so shrewdly on the
head with the butt end of his lance, that he fell from his nag.
He soon recovered, however, and attacked the knight so suddenly
with his spear that he killed him on the spot. He then tried to
take off his armour, but in vain. Fortunately Iwanet happened to
pass that way, and seeing the lad’s difficulty offered to help him.
Percival was soon arrayed in the full suit of armour, which he insisted
on wearing above his other clothes as they had been made
by his mother. This done, he thanked the squire for his timely
assistance, mounted the red knight’s charger, and rode away, he
knew not whither.</p>

<p class='c007'>After he had ridden a long way he came to the castle of
Gurnemann, an elderly man and a brave warrior. The old chief
asked the youth to come in and spend the night under his roof,
and Percival accepted the invitation with pleasure. He was so
taken with his host’s kindly manner, that before the evening was
over he felt drawn to tell him of his mother and all his adventures
since he had left her. Gurnemann persuaded the lad to remain
with him for some time, and began to teach him how to become a
true knight and hero.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not always have your mother’s name upon your lips,” he
would say, “for it sounds childish. Preserve her teaching faithfully
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_433' id='Page_433'>433</a></span>
in your heart, and you will please her more than by talking
of her continually. A knight should be modest, love one maiden
only, not play at love with many women. He should help the
oppressed, and show kindness to all. When he has conquered an
enemy he should show mercy; and when he is conquered he
should not beg for life. To face death boldly is a hero’s glory,
and such death is better than a dishonoured life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these and other words of wisdom the old man strove to
fit the youth for knighthood. At the same time he gave him
fitting clothes, telling him it was no disrespect to his mother to
cease to wear the curious garments with which she had provided
him. Time passed on, and Percival proved such an apt pupil
that Gurnemann grew as proud of him as if he had been his
own son.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he told the youth that the time had come for him to go
out into the world and draw his sword in defence of innocence
and right, for Queen Konduiramur was hard pressed in her capital,
Belripar, by the wild chief Klamide and his seneschal Kingram.
Percival was nothing loth, and at once prepared to go and help
the queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at Belripar, which stood on the sea at the mouth of a
great river, he rowed himself across the stream, his good horse
swimming at his side. Though artillery frowned from the castle
walls, he gained admittance on pronouncing the password given
him by Gurnemann, and was conducted into the queen’s presence.
She received him kindly, and he at once offered her his services.
She entreated him to have nothing to do with so unlucky a cause
as hers; but he was not to be persuaded to abandon her. It
almost seemed as though he had brought good fortune in his train,
for a few days later some ships laden with provisions managed to
run the blockade, and when Percival made a sally on the enemy
soon after, he unhorsed and took prisoner the seneschal Kingram,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_434' id='Page_434'>434</a></span>
whom he set free on condition that he at once set out to tell King
Arthur of his defeat at the hands of the red knight. The same
fate befel Klamide himself not long afterwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Peace was now restored. The people were all devoted to the
young hero who had freed them from Klamide, and were rejoiced
to hear that he was about to marry the queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wedding took place with great pomp and ceremony. In
the midst of all his happiness Percival had only one sorrow, and
that was that his mother was not there to share his joy. He told
Konduiramur what he felt, and she agreed with him that he ought
to go and fetch his mother to Belripar. So Percival mounted
his good horse and rode away.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Quest of the Grail.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>He knew in which direction to go to his mother, but not the
roads that led to her house; so it was not surprising that he lost
his way several times. One day he came to a great lake which he
had never seen before. He saw a man seated in a boat, fishing.
The man was richly dressed, but pale and sad. Percival asked
if he could get food and shelter anywhere about for himself and
his tired horse, and was told that if he went straight on, and did
not lose his way, he would come to a castle, where he would be
kindly received. He started in the direction indicated by the
fisherman, and reached the castle at nightfall, after a long and
toilsome search. There he met with so much kindness and consideration,
garments even being provided for him “by Queen
Repanse’s orders,” that he was filled with amazement. When
freshly attired he was taken into the hall, which was brilliantly
lighted. Four hundred knights were seated on softly-cushioned
seats at small tables, each of which was laid for four. They all
sat grave and silent, as though in expectation. When Percival
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_435' id='Page_435'>435</a></span>
entered, they rose and bowed, and a ray of joy passed over each
woeful countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The master of the house, who much resembled the fisherman
Percival had seen on the lake, sat in an arm-chair near the fire,
wrapped in sables, and was apparently suffering from some
wasting disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deep silence that reigned in the hall was at length broken
by the host, who invited Percival, in a low, weak voice, to sit
down beside him, telling him that he had been long expected,
and, at the same time, giving him a sword of exquisite workmanship.
The young knight was filled with astonishment. A servant
now entered carrying the head of a lance stained with blood,
with which he walked round the room in silence. Percival would
much have liked to ask the meaning of this strange ceremony,
and also how his arrival had come to be expected, but he
feared lest he should be deemed unwarrantably curious. While
thus thinking, the door opened again, and a number of beautiful
blue-eyed maidens came in, two and two, with a velvet cushion
embroidered with pearls, an ebony stand, and various other
articles. Last of all came Queen Repanse bearing a costly vessel,
whose radiance was more than the human eye could steadfastly
gaze upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The holy Grail,” Percival heard whispered by one voice
after another. He longed to question some one; but felt too
much awed by the strangeness and solemnity of all he saw.</p>

<p class='c007'>The maidens withdrew, and the squires and pages of the
knights came forward. Then from the shining vessel streamed an
endless supply of the costliest dishes and wines, which they set
before their masters. The lord of the castle, however, only ate
of one dish, and but a small quantity of that. Percival glanced
round the great hall. What could this strange stillness and sadness
mean?</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_436' id='Page_436'>436</a></span>
When the meal was at an end, the lord of the castle dragged
himself to his feet, leaning on two servants. He looked eagerly
at his guest, and then retired with a deep sigh. Servants now
came to conduct Percival to his sleeping apartment. Before
leaving the hall they opened the door of a room in which a
venerable old man slept on a low couch. His still handsome face
was framed in a coronal of white curls. His sleep was uneasy,
and his lips quivered as though he were trying to speak. The
servants closed the door again, and led Percival to his chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he entered the room he looked about him, and at once
became aware of a picture embroidered on the silken tapestry,
that arrested his attention. It was the picture of a battle, in
which the most prominent figure, a knight strangely like the lord
of the castle in appearance, was sinking to the ground, wounded
by a spear of the same kind as the broken weapon that had been
carried round the hall. Much as he desired to know the meaning
of this, he determined to ask no questions till the following
morning, though the servants told him that his coming had been
long expected, and deliverance was looked for at his hands; and
they went away, sighing deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>His sleep was disturbed by bad dreams, and he awoke next
morning unrefreshed. He found his own clothes and armour
beside his bed; but no one came to help him. He got up and
dressed. All the doors in the castle were locked except those
that led out to the ramparts, where his horse stood saddled and
bridled at the drawbridge. No sooner had he crossed the bridge
than it was drawn up behind him, and a voice called out from
the battlements:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Accursed of God, thou that wast chosen to do a great work,
and hast not done it. Go, and return no more. Walk thy evil
way till it leads thee down to hell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero turned, and looked back at the castle: a face with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_437' id='Page_437'>437</a></span>
a fiendish grin glared at him for a moment over the battlements,
and then disappeared. Percival put spurs to his horse, and rode
away. He journeyed all day long through bleak, inhospitable
country, and at nightfall reached a solitary cell. He dismounted,
hobbled his horse, and entered the quiet room. A woman
crouched on the floor praying. She wore a penitent’s grey robe,
and her long hair lay neglected about her face and neck. Startled
by his entrance, she rose slowly to her feet and looked at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, you?” she said, “Herzeleide’s wretched son! What
do you want of me? Tchionatulander’s body is embalmed, and
I have laid it in this chest. Here I must kneel and pray, and do
penance till the All-Merciful sets me free.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good heavens!” said the hero to himself, “it is Sigune; but
how changed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The unhappy woman stared at him for some time in silence,
then she went on, “Wretched man, do you not know that you are
lost for ever. You were permitted to look upon the holy Grail,
yet, of your own will you put aside the opportunity of freeing
the poor sufferer from his pain. Do not longer pollute this cell
with your unhallowed presence. Go, flee, till the curse overtake
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stood before him like an angry prophetess. A feeling of
dread, such as he had never known before, took possession of him,
and he staggered out of her presence and into the night. He
walked on and on, leading his horse, till at length he sank on
the ground, and found relief from his troubles in a sound and
refreshing sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was high in the heavens when he awoke. His faithful
horse was grazing near him, so he mounted and rode on without
knowing or caring where he went. As evening came on, a farmer
met him, and offered him a night’s lodging, which he thankfully
accepted. Next day, when he resumed his journey, he was able
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_438' id='Page_438'>438</a></span>
to think more calmly of all that had occurred; and came to
the conclusion that he ought to return to the castle, and try to
expiate the sin he had committed unconsciously. But he could
not find the way to it. He asked every one he met to show him
the way to the castle where the holy Grail was to be seen: but
every one took him for a fool or a madman. As he rode on sadly,
he met a knight leading a woman in chains. He at once recognised
the beautiful lady from whom he had stolen the kiss when
she was asleep. She looked at him in silent entreaty, so he
felt himself bound to help her. He desired the knight to let the
poor woman go, but was answered with a scornful laugh. Upon
this the fight began, and raged hotly for some time. At last
Percival was victorious. As he was about to slay his fallen and
unconscious foe, he remembered Sir Gurnemann’s teaching, and
refrained. Leaving the man lying on the ground, he turned to
the lady, and freed her from her chains. By this time the fallen
knight had regained his senses, and Percival let him go after
making him swear to treat the lady for the future with all
courtesy, and to go to King Arthur’s court and say that he had
been defeated by the red knight. Before they parted, Percival
learned that his opponent was Sir Orilus, and that the lady
was his wife, whom, ever since that scene in the tent, he had
persecuted out of groundless jealousy. Percival solemnly swore
that the meeting had been innocent and accidental, and thus he
brought about a sincere reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero continued his search for the holy Grail, but all in
vain. He followed out the quest in summer’s heat and winter’s
storm, yet never seemed to get nearer the goal. One day he
met Sir Gawain, King Arthur’s nephew, who asked him to come
back to court with him, and see the king, and be made a knight
of the Round Table. Percival at once consented, hoping, as he
did so, to learn something from Arthur about the holy Grail.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_439' id='Page_439'>439</a></span>
Sir Gawain sent a squire on to announce the red knight’s
arrival to his uncle, so the king came out to meet them, accompanied
by his heroes and many of the townsfolks, for all were
anxious to see the warrior of whose powers so much had been
heard and of whom so little was known. On the following day,
in the open field, Percival received from Arthur’s hand the sign
of knighthood, and was enrolled a member of the Round Table.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whilst the heralds were yet proclaiming the new knight’s name
and deeds, a woman rode into the royal presence on a miserable
nag. She threw back her veil on approaching the king, and
displayed a hideous countenance, brown, yellow, and grey, like
a withered leaf, and her eyes glowed like burning coals out
of their deep sockets.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the witch Kundrie, the messenger of the Sangreal,”
cried many voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is even she,” said the woman, “and she comes to cry woe
upon King Arthur and his Round Table if they suffer the
man I shall name to remain in their midst. Percival is unworthy
of the honour you have shown him. He was chosen
to the highest dignity, and has wickedly neglected to end the
pains of the greatest sufferer upon earth. Woe unto him! Woe
unto Arthur and his heroes, if the unhallowed presence of the
dishonoured knight be not at once removed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Every eye was fixed now on the prophetess, and now upon
Sir Percival, who, horror-stricken at what had occurred, slipped
quietly out of the assemblage, and, mounting his horse, rode
away. Amongst all the heroes of the Round Table there was
only one who took his part, and that was Gawain. He said it
was a shame to let the flower of chivalry thus depart on the
word of a hawk-nosed witch. Upon this Kundrie got into a
great rage, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thou wretch, the curse hath fallen upon thee too. Go, if thou
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_440' id='Page_440'>440</a></span>
dare, and find Klinschor’s magic castle, where thy grandmother,
thy mother, and sister, and other noble ladies lie under the spell
of enchantment; free them if thou canst!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gawain turned, and went away without a word. He mounted
his horse, and set out in pursuit of Percival.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Klinschor’s Enchanted Castle.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Wherever the hero went, he found people who told him they
had met the red knight, and again he came up with armed men
who had fought with him and whom he had conquered. So the
days and weeks passed on, and he still continued to follow
Percival until he lost all trace of him in the far East. At
last he heard of him again, and seeking him, heard more of his
great deeds, but himself he could not find.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Gawain thought the matter over carefully, and made up
his mind that the best way to find Percival, would be to seek
out the holy Grail, for which he also sought.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he rode along, he met a knight whom Percival had wounded.
Gawain offered him help; but Kingrimursel, as the man was
called, felt too sore about his defeat to be able to accept any kindness,
and at once challenged Gawain to fight him when his wounds
were healed. Before the hero had gone much farther he met a
woman whose beauty made him forget both the challenge and the
holy Grail, and even the red knight. And indeed she was a lady
of most marvellous beauty; her dark hair fell down her neck in
curls, and her eyes gleamed like stars. Gawain approached her,
and entered into conversation with her. Finding her as wise and
witty as she was fair, he told her that he loved her; but she only
laughed at him. He persisted, so she said that if he would find
favour in her sight, he must go into the garden hard by, and fetch
out her white palfrey.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went to the garden gate, and seeing an elderly man standing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_441' id='Page_441'>441</a></span>
within, he asked him where he should find the lady’s palfrey. The
man shook his head sadly as he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah my friend, take care. That lady is the Duchess Orgueilleuse,
a witch who has caused the death of many a noble knight,
and for whose sake the great King Amfortas faced the danger in
which he was wounded by the poisoned spear. Throw off her
bonds while yet you can. Look, there is your horse. Mount, and
ride away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The warning was vain: a mere waste of words. It was as
though the haughty duchess had cast a spell over Sir Gawain.
He was powerless in her hands. He brought her the palfrey, and
not noticing the supercilious way in which she refused all help
from him in mounting, followed her with passive obedience through
many lands. Many a battle had he to fight for her sweet sake,
and every now and then, he could not help seeing that it was she
who brought on the fight, when otherwise there would have been
none. Yet he was always victorious, and never swerved from his
fealty to the lady of his love, who was now pleased to allow him
to ride beside her.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length they reached a hill-top from which they had an
extensive view over a wide valley. Opposite, there was a castle
perched on the top of a high rock, and overshadowed by a gigantic
pine-tree. Orgueilleuse pointed to it, and said that it belonged
to Gramoflans, her mortal enemy, and the man who had slain her
lover. “Now,” she continued, “if you will bring me a spray of
the magic tree yonder, and conquer Gramoflans, who will at once
challenge you to single-combat, I will—be your—your faithful
wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The knight would have fought the prince of darkness himself
for such a prize, so he set spurs to his horse without a moment’s
hesitation, and rode away in the direction of the castle. He
crossed the valley, swam over a deep moat, and reached the tree.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_442' id='Page_442'>442</a></span>
He pulled a small branch, and tried to weave it into a wreath,
but as he did so, he heard a voice call in angry tones:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you doing there, rash youth? How dare you touch
my magic tree! I know you well, you are Sir Gawain, a knight
of the Round Table. Your father slew my father long ago, and
I intend to have vengeance. Meet me, therefore, in eight days
time before Klinschor’s magic castle. There shall twelve hundred
of my warriors see me avenge my father’s death. You may bring
as many men, or more, if you like.” So saying, the speaker
turned his back upon the hero and re-entered his castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gawain brought the wreath to his lady, who received it calmly.
She did not waste her words in thanks, but pursued her way in
silence; he accompanying her wherever she chose to go. After a
time, they came in sight of two strong castles, one of which, the
duchess said, was Logreis, her father’s ancestral residence, and the
other was Klinschor’s magic castle, in which the great magician,
Klinschor, kept the noble dames and damsels he had stolen, in
close confinement and laden with heavy chains. She herself, she
added, had only bought her freedom by giving the monster all
the gold she had inherited from her father. Scarcely had she
uttered these words, when a grim warrior appeared, and called
to Gawain to defend himself. Orgueilleuse withdrew, reminding
Gawain of her promise. A few minutes later, having overthrown
his adversary, the knight got into the ferry-boat, that had just
returned from setting the duchess on the other side of the water,
and went across. That night he lodged with the ferryman, who
told him all the gossip of the place, and particularly of the great
doings of a valiant knight clad in red armour.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic067'>
<img src='images/i_444.jpg' alt='GAWAIN BREAKS THE SPELL IN KLINSCHOR’S CASTLE.' class='ig067' />
<p>GAWAIN BREAKS THE SPELL IN KLINSCHOR’S CASTLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As darkness came on, Gawain went to the window, and looked
out. He saw the lighted windows of the magician’s castle, at each
of which a sad female face appeared. The women were a curious
medley. Their ages seemed to range from early childhood to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_445' id='Page_445'>445</a></span>
grey old age. Sir Gawain turned wrathfully from the sight,
saying that he would slay the caitiff knight, and set the wretched
ladies free; but the ferryman bade him beware what he did, for
Klinschor was not only very strong, but was learned in the black
art. Sir Gawain, however, was not to be dissuaded from the
emprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>He mounted his horse early next morning, and set out for the
magic castle, the towers of which rose dark and mysterious-looking
before him. He was admitted into the court by a gigantic
porter, who opened the door for him without making any difficulty.
The building seemed totally deserted. Not a household utensil
was to be seen anywhere, nor any woman. He wandered from
room to room lost in astonishment. At last he came to a room
in which a comfortable couch was spread, and as he felt tired,
he thought he would lie down and rest for a little; but, to his
intense surprise, the bed retreated as he advanced, and he could
not get in. Rendered impatient by this he boldly leapt upon
the bed, and next instant was assailed by a perfect storm of
arrows, lances, javelins, and heavy stones. From these he guarded
himself as well as he could. Had he not been dressed in full
armour, he would speedily have been slain, and even as it was
he received many a wound.</p>

<p class='c007'>The terrible hail of weapons ceased as suddenly as it had begun.
A stillness as of death set in. The silence was at length broken
by the heavy tramp of a peasant, who entered the room bearing
a great club in his hand, and followed by a lion. The man was
of enormous size, and his voice was deep and gruff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quiet, Leo,” he said, “I am going to break that fellow’s skull
before I throw you his carcase. What!” he continued in amazement,
“still alive, and in full armour! Nay then, go at him yourself,
good Leo.” So saying, he hastened away as fast as his legs
would carry him.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_446' id='Page_446'>446</a></span>
The lion sprang upon the hero, and tried to tear him with its
claws; but almost instantly fell backwards with a howl of mingled
rage and pain, for Gawain had cut off one of its fore-paws. The
hero now jumped out of bed, and attacked the lion with such
hearty good will that he finally killed it; but the exhaustion
caused by the protracted struggle was so great that he sank fainting
on its carcase.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he came to himself again he found a number of women
bending over him, and calling him their deliverer. Amongst
them were his grandmother, his mother, and his sister Itonie.
The spell was broken, and Klinschor had fled. As soon as
Gawain had a little recovered from his fatigue, he sent messengers
to tell Arthur what had happened, and to ask him to come
and witness the combat that was to take place between him
and Gramoflans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arthur came, and Sir Gawain felt that his cup of happiness
was full when he presented the beautiful Lady Orgueilleuse to
his uncle.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the wished-for day of combat dawned. A knight
arrived dressed in black, and riding on a coal black steed.
Gawain rode forward to meet him. Their swords flashed, and
they fought as beseemed noble knights in such fair company.
The king and the ladies drew nearer that they might the better
watch the skill of the combatants. Gradually the black knight
had the best of the fight. Gawain’s strength to parry the
thrusts of his adversary grew less and less. Suddenly a maiden
darted from amongst the spectators, and cried,—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Noble knight, spare my brother Gawain, he is yet weak
from the many wounds he received in the magic castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gawain!” echoed the stranger, raising his visor, and displaying
the well-known features of Sir Percival.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meeting of the friends was right joyful, and while they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_447' id='Page_447'>447</a></span>
talked, another knight came forward and asked for reconciliation
and friendship with the other two. This was Gramoflans, who
had long been secretly betrothed to the gentle Itonie. But
Gawain knew too well what depended on their combat; he
knew that the lady Orgueilleuse was only to be won by defeating
this man, whom she hated. He laid his hand upon his sword
and would have spoken, but the great king drew near and stopped
him. He promised on his word of honour to soften the heart
of the proud duchess, and bring her to his nephew. Then sending
for the lady, he took her apart and talked with her, and his
wisdom and nobleness so wrought upon her that her anger left
her, and she forgave her foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days afterwards two marriages were solemnized at the
castle, and Queen Guinevere did all that she could to ensure the
general happiness. Sir Percival was at the same time openly
received as Knight of the Round Table; but still he was not
happy. He could not forget. He heard as distinctly as of yore
the curse that the witch had pronounced against him; he always
saw the face of the sufferer Amfortas, the Sangreal, and further
in the background his lovely wife and weeping mother. He
could not bear it, so he slipped quietly away without taking leave
of the king or any one. The innocent joy of his friends but
increased his grief.</p>

<p class='c007'>He rode away, a feeling of almost despair possessing him.
Should he never find the holy Grail, should he never be able
to right the wrong he had done so unconsciously?</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Percival, Trevrezent, and the Grail.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Summer and autumn were gone, and the ground was covered
with snow, when one evening Percival saw the dwelling of a
recluse at a little distance. He was half frozen with cold, and
so very weary, that when he dismounted he could only drag
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_448' id='Page_448'>448</a></span>
himself with difficulty to the door. A tall and stately, but somewhat
haggard man answered his knock, and told him to come
in, while he attended to his horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hermit gave him food, and spread a bed of moss for him,
and while resting there, Percival began to look about him. He
saw a sword with a richly carved hilt, inlaid with gold, hanging
on the wall, and asked to whom it had belonged. The hermit
sighed as he answered that it had belonged to him at the time
when he cared for nothing but glory and love, and forgot the
holy Grail, the care of which had been committed to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For, stranger,” he continued, “you must know that I am
Trevrezent, brother of the unhappy King Amfortas, and that,
like him, I devoted my life to the pursuit of fleeting pleasures.
When the poisoned lance struck Amfortas, and caused him the
unspeakable pain that he still endures, I laid aside my sword
and armour and retired to this solitary place that I might do
penance for my own sins, and perhaps even redeem my brother.
Idle hope! the sufferer still endures his agony, and he that was
chosen by God to save him neglected to do it, and has earned
thereby the curse of perdition instead of the glorious place that
was prepared for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am he who sinned so deeply, yet unconsciously,” cried
Percival, “but where is the justice or love of a Being that
punishes the sin of ignorance with such a curse?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you are Percival, the son of my sister Herzeleide,” said
Trevrezent. “You found the way to the Grail, but not to
redemption, for you did not know the All-merciful, who only
speaks in those who have received Him into their hearts.
Hearken to me, and I will unfold the wondrous goodness and
love He has shown to the children of men, that you may learn
to endure and to trust.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Trevrezent then proceeded to tell his nephew of God’s dealings
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_449' id='Page_449'>449</a></span>
with man from the beginning of time until the coming and death
of Christ, and to show him what lessons might be learnt therefrom.
He afterwards told him that his mother had died of
sorrow not long after his departure, and that in dying she had
blessed him. He went on to say that Percival must now seek
the Sangreal with a pure heart and humble mind, trusting in
God, who knew that he had repented, and whose mercy was
without end.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero remained for some days with his uncle, who strengthened
and encouraged him to perform the task that lay before
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last, taking leave of Trevrezent, he departed and journeyed
for a great distance without seeing any trace of the holy mountain.
One day he met a knight who insisted on fighting with
him. But suddenly in the middle of the fray Percival’s sword
broke, and he exclaimed that if he had had his father Gamuret’s
weapon it would not have played him such a sorry trick. The
stranger then questioned him about Gamuret, and after he had
heard what Percival had to say, he added:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you and I are brothers, for when Gamuret was in
the East, he married the Moorish queen; after her death he
returned home and wedded your mother. I was brought up
by my mother’s relations, and am now king of the Moors.
My name is Feirefiss.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying he opened his visor and showed Percival a dark,
handsome face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brothers embraced with great affection, and Percival
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sword that Amfortas the sufferer gave me would not
drink a brother’s blood; this is the first sign that God has
heard my prayers. And—but was I blind?—surely I know
this place! There is the lake, the rocks are here—yes, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_450' id='Page_450'>450</a></span>
is the road to the holy mountain. Come, brother, follow me
up the steep path to the heights above, where Divine mercy
awaits us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both heroes set out on their toilsome road with a stout heart
and a willing mind; but the way was so full of difficulties that
the sun was about to set before they reached the castle. On
their arrival they were received like expected guests, and their
horses—which they had been obliged to lead most of the way—were
taken to the stable. Percival and Feirefiss were conducted
straight to the hall, which was brilliantly lighted with
wax candles. King Amfortas and his knights were in their
usual places. The squire then came in with the bleeding lance,
and was followed as before by the maidens bearing the cushion,
stand, etc., and lastly, by the fair virgin, Queen Repanse carrying
the holy Grail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merciful Father, and our sweet Lord and Saviour,” whispered
Sir Percival, “teach me what I must do to bring redemption.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And it seemed to him that an angel spoke in his ear the one
word, “Ask!” His understanding was now enlightened. He
knew what to do. Going up to Amfortas he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What ails you, great king? and why are the halls that contain
the holy Grail filled with mourning and woe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The candles went out, but the Sangreal spread a brighter
radiance than before throughout the room, and on the side of
the sacred vessel appeared in letters of flame, “Amfortas is cured;
Percival shall be king.” At the same moment soft and heavenly
music filled the air, and invisible angels sang “Glory to God
on high, and on earth peace, goodwill to men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero stood silent, his heart overflowing with joy and
thankfulness. An old man now approached him with a firm
step and dignified mien. He bore a crown in his hands, and
this he set on the head of the chosen king, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_451' id='Page_451'>451</a></span>
“Hail, Percival, all hail! Long have we waited for your
coming. I am your great-grandfather Titurel, and have been
called to make over to you the insignia of the highest honour.
Now I may depart in peace. The days of my earthly pilgrimage
will soon be over, and I shall rest in the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Amfortas, who was now well, and free from pain, rose from
his seat, and greeting Percival with solemn joy, placed the royal
mantle on his shoulders, calling on him to uphold the right, and
to punish all injustice and wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>The assembled knights joined in proclaiming the new king,
and in swearing to be true to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the angelic choir sang in jubilant tones:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hail to thee Percival, king of the Grail!</div>
      <div class='line'>Seemingly lost for ever,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now thou art blest for ever.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hail to thee Percival, king of the Grail!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While Percival stood there, touched and softened by all that
had happened, the door opened, and a veiled lady came in,
followed by her train. As he looked at her inquiringly, she
threw back her veil, and showed the face of Konduiramur, the
wife he loved so well, and from whom he had so long been
absent.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was strange that the light shed by the holy Grail left one
man, and one alone, in darkness. This was Feirefiss, the Moorish
king, who seemed to be overshadowed by a dark cloud. He
asked, whence came the bright rays that lighted the hall, but did
not fall upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sacred vessel,” replied old Titurel, “that received the
Saviour’s blood, only enlightens those who believe. You still live
in the darkness of unbelief, in the bonds of the Evil One. Bow
your head before Christ the crucified, the Prince of Light and
Truth, and your heart also shall be enlightened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_452' id='Page_452'>452</a></span>
The old man’s words had a strong effect upon Feirefiss, who
desired, and immediately received, baptism at the hands of
Titurel; and no sooner was the rite concluded than he too could
see the Sangreal, and was embraced in the radiance that
emanated from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that, Titurel knelt down before the sacred vessel and
prayed. Having done this, he rose from his knees, and, taking
solemn leave of all, told them that Sigune was now at rest.
Having thus spoken, he passed out of the hall, and was no more
seen of them, or of any mortal man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Feirefiss remained for some time at the castle on the holy
mount. While there, he received instruction in the Christian
faith, and when he went away, he took as his wife the fair Queen
Repanse, to rule with him over his own land. They had a son
named John, who became a great warrior, and who formed a
brotherhood, like that of the Templars, of the holy Grail; a
brotherhood, strong, mighty, enduring, and of great renown.</p>

    <p>ELSE’S DREAM.</p>

    <h3 id='p3c2s3'>III.<br />
    LOHENGRIN.<br />(LOHERANGRIN.)</h3>

    <p class='center'><span class='sc'>The Silver Bell.</span></p>

<p class='dc17'>Under the lead of Gawain and
others, and lastly of Arthur
himself, the knights of the Round Table sought in vain for that
which lay so near, yet seemed so far, because their dim vision
could not pierce the earthly mists that cloud Heaven from our
view. Some said that angels had conveyed the Holy Mountain
farther East, where it was guarded by Prester John; and that only
when wild Saracens threatened Christendom, did the Templars
appear with the silver dove on shield and helmet, and help to win
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_454' id='Page_454'>454</a></span>
the victory; then they vanished, and none knew whence they
came or whither they went.</p>
<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Percival and Konduiramur lived happily together,
serving in the Temple of the Sangreal, and educating their
children with the greatest care. Kardeiss, the eldest son, on
reaching man’s estate, was made ruler over his mother’s kingdom
of Belripar, and over his patrimony of Waleis and Anjou. The
younger son, Lohengrin, remained at home with his parents,
while the daughter, Aribadale, took the place of Queen Repanse,
and bore the holy Grail from the altar to the hall and back
again. It was long since any of the knights of the temple had
been called by the sound of the silver bell to go out and fight
against the unbelievers, for the Saracens had been completely
conquered by the Christians. But one evening, when the knights
were all assembled round the king in the royal hall, the silver
bell was heard apparently at a great distance, but coming ever
nearer and nearer. It sounded like a cry for help. At the
same moment the announcement appeared on the sacred vessel in
letters of flame, that Lohengrin was the hero chosen by God to
defend the rights of the innocent, and that he should be borne
whither he should go, in a boat drawn by a white swan with a
crown upon its neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hail Lohengrin, chosen of the Lord!” cried the knights of
the temple.</p>

<p class='c007'>Percival rejoiced greatly, and embraced, and blessed his son,
while Konduiramur, her heart filled with joy at Lohengrin’s high
calling, and also with anxiety about his safety, went to fetch the
armour inlaid with gold that Amfortas had once worn, and the
sword that had broken during Percival’s fight with his brother
Feirefiss, but which had since been re-forged and tempered in the
sanctuary of the Sangreal.</p>

<p class='c007'>A squire now entered the hall, and announced that a boat lay
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_455' id='Page_455'>455</a></span>
in the lake below the mountain, which a swan with a golden crown
was towing by a chain of gold. This was the sign that the hour
of the young hero’s departure was come. The king and queen,
and all the knights accompanied him to the shore, where the boat
awaited him. As he was about to embark, Percival gave him a
golden horn, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blow three times on this horn as a sign that you have arrived
amongst the worldly-minded children of men, and again three
times to show that you are coming home; for, if you are ever
asked from whence you came, and of what family you are sprung,
you must at once be up and away on your return to the holy
mountain. This is the indestructible law of the brotherhood of
the Sangreal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lohengrin sprang into the boat, and the swan swam away with
it, bearing it towards the sea. The air was full of the softest
strains of music; but whether it was the swan that sang, or a
choir of angels, Lohengrin could not tell. The music ceased when
the boat reached the sea. Its place was taken by the howling of
the storm, and the sound of many waters. When night came
on, the young hero stretched himself in the bottom of the boat,
and fell asleep, undisturbed by wind or waves.</p>
</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Fair-Else, the Duchess.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>One day the youthful Duchess of Brabant had gone out to hunt.
She was of such surpassing beauty that she was always called
Fair-Else. On this occasion she had somehow got separated
from her companions, and to tell the truth, she was not at all
sorry, for she wanted to have a little quiet time for thought; so
she threw herself on the grass under a great linden tree, and
began to ponder over her troubles. She had many lovers, and
would gladly have got rid of them all, especially of the Count of
Telramund, a mighty warrior and her former guardian, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_456' id='Page_456'>456</a></span>
persisted in maintaining that her father had promised her to him
on his death-bed. The young duchess both hated and feared the
count. She had refused point-blank to marry him in spite of his
threats, and he now declared that he would make war upon
her, and would also bring a heavy charge against her before the
newly-elected German King, Heinrich of Saxony. Else thought
over all these things with a heavy heart, till she fell asleep,
lulled by the humming of the bees and the soft murmur of the
wind in the branches overhead. And in her sleep she dreamt.
It was a strange dream. She thought that a youthful hero came
to her out of the wood, and offering her a little silver bell, told
her to ring it if ever she needed assistance, and he would come
without delay. It seemed to her that she tried to take the bell
but could not, and in the effort she awoke. While puzzling over
the meaning of her dream, she became aware of a falcon hovering
over her. It wheeled round her head several times, and finally
perched on her shoulder. Tied round its neck was a silver bell
exactly like the one she had seen in her dream. She gently
detached the bell and the falcon flew away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after she returned home, a messenger arrived to summon
her before King Heinrich’s judgment-seat at Cologne on the
Rhine. She obeyed the summons with a heart at ease, for she
felt herself in the keeping of a Higher Power, and trusted in the
hope her dream held out to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>King Heinrich was a man who both loved and exercised
justice; but the empire sorely needed stout defenders,—hordes
of wild Hungarians ravaged the south every year,—and Count
Telramund was a mighty warrior whose assistance was of great
value to him, so he hoped that his claims would be successfully
proved.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic069'>
<img src='images/i_458.jpg' alt='LOHENGRIN’S ARRIVAL.' class='ig069' />
<p>LOHENGRIN’S ARRIVAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The trial began. Three witnesses were brought to prove that
the duchess loved one of her vassals, and for a lady in her position
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_459' id='Page_459'>459</a></span>
to marry a vassal was strictly forbidden by the laws of the realm.
Two of the witnesses, however, were declared false and perjured;
and the evidence of one witness was not enough. Then the
count stood up, and offered to show the truth of his allegation
against the duchess by challenging to single combat any knight
that the Lady Else might choose to defend her cause, and might
God show the right.</p>

<p class='c007'>The challenge could not be refused, but three days’ time were
allowed her to find a champion. Else looked round the hall to
see if any noble warrior would defend her, but all feared the
terrible strength and skill of Count Telramund. No one moved;
a silence as of death reigned in the court. Then the maiden
remembered the silver bell. She drew it from her bosom and
rang it, and the clear sound that it gave forth pealed through
the silent hall, and passed on in louder and louder echoes till it
was lost in the distant mountains. After that she turned to the
king and said that her champion should appear at the appointed
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three days were over. The king was seated on his chair of
state overlooking the lists, and thoughtfully gazed over the rushing
waters of the Rhine that flowed close to where the combat was to
take place. His princes and knights surrounded him, and before
him stood Count Telramund in battle array, and the fair duchess,
who looked lovelier than ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three times the count called upon the champion who was to
defend the Lady Else to appear. He received no answer. All
eyes were fixed upon the king, anxious to hear whether he would
now pronounce judgment on the accused. While he yet hesitated,
distant music was heard coming over the Rhine. The sounds
were passing sweet, such as none had ever heard before.
A few moments later a boat was seen approaching the shore,
drawn by a white swan with a golden crown upon its neck, and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_460' id='Page_460'>460</a></span>
the boat a knight clad in rich armour was lying asleep. As the
prow touched the land, he awoke, and sounded a golden horn
three times. The notes echoed across the river, and were lost in
the distance. This was the sign that he accepted the position
of champion of innocence. He understood what was required of
him, and disembarking, entered the lists where his adversary
was awaiting him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the fight began, the herald came forward, and demanded
the stranger’s name and condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name is Lohengrin,” answered the knight, “and I am of
royal birth; more than that you need not know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is sufficient,” replied the king; “your patent of nobility is
written on your forehead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The trumpets sounded to battle, and the combat began. Telramund’s
blows fell thick and fast, and the stranger knight at first
contented himself with standing on the defensive; but suddenly
changing his tactics, he attacked in his turn, and with one blow he
cleft the count’s helmet and head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God has decided,” said the king, “and His judgments are just.
As for you, noble knight, will you accompany us on our expedition
against the wild invaders, and command the contingent that the
fair duchess will send us from Brabant?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lohengrin joyfully accepted the proposal, and at the same
moment the Lady Else came up and thanked him for the great
service he had done her. She had recognised him from the first
moment of his appearance as the hero of her dream, and her heart
was full of wonder and gratitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the journey to Brabant, Lohengrin and Else saw a great
deal of each other, and the more they saw, the more they liked.
In the castle at Antwerp they were publicly betrothed, and a few
weeks later, married.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the bridal pair left the cathedral after the wedding,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_461' id='Page_461'>461</a></span>
Lohengrin told his wife that she must never question him as to the
place from whence he came, or as to his parentage, for if she did,
he must leave her that very hour, and leave her for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were startled out of their honeymoon by the king’s call to
arms. Numerous robber hordes from Hungary had invaded the
land, so King Heinrich had determined to collect his armies at
Cologne, and march against the foe. The duchess, like most
of the other ladies, went with her husband to the royal city.
There were many great warriors amongst the princes of the empire,
and the ladies used to talk of their glorious deeds and those
of their ancestors; but when Else’s husband was mentioned, a
strange silence would fall upon the company, for rumours ran that
Lohengrin was the son of a heathen magician, and that he had
gained the victory over Count Telramund by his knowledge of the
black art.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Parting.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>When Else heard the scandalous tale, she was deeply hurt, for
she knew her husband’s noble nature. She longed for the power
of justifying him, and of making the scandal-mongers eat their
words, and reverence her hero. So full did she become of these
thoughts that she forgot her husband’s warning, and, going to him
one day, told him of her trouble, and asked him whose son he was,
and whence he came.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear wife,” he said, in quiet sorrow, “I will now tell you, and
the king and all the princes, what was hidden and ought to have
remained hidden for ever; but remember, the hour of our parting
approaches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero led his trembling wife before the king and his nobles,
who were assembled on the banks of the Rhine. He told them of
his great father, Percival, and of his own coming to Cologne in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_462' id='Page_462'>462</a></span>
obedience to the Divine order conveyed to him by the holy
Grail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would fain have fought the barbarians with you, noble king,”
he continued, “but destiny calls me hence. Be of good cheer—you
will conquer the robbers, rule over the heathen, and win imperishable
glory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hero spoke with the enthusiasm of an inspired seer, as he
added a prophecy of the wonders time should unfold regarding
the future of the empire. When he ceased, all present heard the
same strange wild melody that had attended his coming, but this
time sad and slow as a dirge. It came nigher, and then they spied
also the crowned swan and the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Farewell, beloved,” said Lohengrin, clasping his weeping wife
in his arms. “I had grown to love you, and life in this world
of yours, passing well; but now a higher will than mine tells me
to go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He tore himself away with tears in his eyes, and entering the
boat, which the swan had brought close to the bank, was borne
away from their sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not long survive the parting from her husband, and
when she died, she died in the firm conviction that she was about
to join her husband and see the holy Grail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether she was right or wrong, none of those about her could
ever agree.</p>

</div>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Trusty Rual and His Foster-Son.</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >A furious battle was raging before the gates of the castle,
for Rivalin, the lord of the place, was fighting against
Morgan, his feudal superior, whose oppression had grown too
great to be borne. Within the castle, Blancheflur, Rivalin’s wife,
was praying fervently for her husband’s safety, as she clasped in
her weak arms her little son that had been born while the din of
battle filled the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_464' id='Page_464'>464</a></span>
All day long it lasted. In the evening, Rual, the marshal, hurried
back into the castle bleeding, and called to his wife to save what
she could, and make ready for instant flight, for King Rivalin had
fallen, and the enemy threatened to blockade the castle. Queen
Blancheflur heard what he said, and with a piercing cry fell back
dead. Rual, seeing that nothing could be done for her, hurried
the other women in their preparations, and, heedless of his own
untended wounds, made ready to fly with his master’s child
to a place of safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while they hastened to obey the marshal, it was already too
late—the castle was surrounded, and no way of escape remained.
They carried the dead queen to another room, and the marshal’s
wife took the baby for her own. The servants were all faithful,
and when Morgan took the castle soon afterwards, he never guessed
that Rivalin had left a living child. The victorious king, who
honoured Rual for his fidelity to his late master, made him
governor of the kingdom he had just subdued, and then went
back to his own place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Time passed on, and the foster-parents were delighted with the
good qualities their pupil developed. They had had him christened
Tristram, or Tristan (Sorrowful), because of the sad
circumstances that had attended his birth. Rual himself taught
him all knightly exercises, and got him tutors to instruct him in
music, languages, and many other accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day some foreign merchants landed on the coast, and
offered their wares for sale. Young Tristram often went down to
see them, and questioned them about their country, and about the
many strange lands they visited. The boy’s unusual beauty and
the great knowledge he possessed aroused their cupidity. They
determined to steal him, and sell him in some foreign country
where he would bring a good price. So once, when he was on
board their ship, they quietly raised the anchor, and set sail.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_465' id='Page_465'>465</a></span>
Rual pursued them, but they escaped, owing to the greater swiftness
of their vessel. Another danger, however, threatened to overwhelm
them. A terrific storm came on, worse than any they had
ever encountered before. They thought it a sign of God’s wrath,
and were filled with fear and awe. In the perturbation of their
souls they swore to set the boy free, and they kept their word.
They put him ashore on an unknown coast, feeling assured that
with his uncommon gifts he would soon make a livelihood. They
were not mistaken. A troup of pilgrims happening to pass
that way, Tristram joined them, and accompanied them to the
court of King Mark of Cornwall. The king took the boy into
his service as page, and grew very fond of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime Rual had sought his foster-son everywhere, and was
broken-hearted at not being able to find him, or hear any news
of him. He wandered from one country to another, begging his
way. At last, footsore and weary, he arrived at King Mark’s
court. Tristram greeted him with joy, and took him to the king.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mark heard who the supposed beggar was, he exclaimed
angrily:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! Are you the former marshal of the traitor Rivalin,
who stole away my sister Blancheflur?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire,” replied Rual, “love made him do so. The Lady
Blancheflur had been secretly married to my master before she
went away from here. She and her husband are both dead, and
this youth,” laying his hand on Tristram’s shoulder, “whom I
have brought up from his infancy, and whom I have sought for
years, is their only child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king was astonished to hear this tale, and was pleased to
find that his favourite page was in reality his nephew. Rual remained
in Cornwall with his foster-son, for, his wife being dead, he
did not care to return home, and again endure Morgan’s despotic
sway.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_466' id='Page_466'>466</a></span>
Tristram grew up to be a tall and handsome man, a brave
warrior, and a noble knight, as much beloved in peace as in war.
But although he lived a full and joyous life, he could not forget his
native land, and often mourned over the thought that his fellow-countrymen
and rightful subjects groaned under the tyranny of a
foreign oppressor. He at last explained his feelings on the subject
to his uncle, who gave him men and ships, telling him to go and
set his people free, but making him promise to return to Cornwall
afterwards, as he had appointed him to succeed him on the
throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>The expedition was successful. Morgan was defeated and slain,
and Tristram was crowned King of Parmenia. He remained for a
year longer in his native land, settling all differences, and arranging
matters for the good of his subjects. Having done this, he made
Rual governor of the realm, and returned to Cornwall as he had
promised.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Isolde (Yseult, Isoud).</span></div>

<p class='c007'>On his arrival there, he found every one in great distress. King
Gurmun of Ireland had, during his absence, invaded Cornwall, and,
with the help of his brother-in-law Morolt, a powerful chief and
great warrior, had subdued the country, and forced King Mark to
pay him tribute; and a shameful tribute it was. By the treaty
with Gurmun, the Cornish king was bound to send thirty handsome
boys of noble birth to Ireland every year, to be sold as slaves for the
benefit of the Irish king. On the very day of Tristram’s return,
Mark was about to deliver the thirty boys into the hands of grim
Morolt, Gurmun’s messenger, who had come to receive them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tristram was very angry when he heard the news, and told the
knights they were cowards ever to have consented to such an
arrangement. Then going straight to Morolt, he tore up the
treaty, saying it was too inhuman to be kept. Morolt’s only
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_467' id='Page_467'>467</a></span>
answer was to draw his sword and challenge him to single combat.
He accepted, and the fight began. After some time, Morolt,
having severely wounded Tristram, cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yield, Sir Tristram: I feel pity for your youth. Yield, and my
sister, Queen Isolde, shall cure your wound, for she alone can heal
a wound made by my poisoned blade.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Death rather,” exclaimed the young knight, and making a
mighty effort, he split his adversary’s head open from crown to jaw.</p>

<p class='c007'>This settled the matter. The Irish returned home sadly, bearing
with them the corpse of their hero, while the victor went back to
his uncle’s palace. His wound was washed and bound, but it would
not heal. It continued to fester, in spite of the use of balm, and
other herbs of well-known excellence. An experienced doctor
who was called in to see the patient, said that only the Irish queen
Isolde, and her daughter of the same name, possessed the art of
drawing such poison out of a wound. So Tristram determined to
go to Ireland in the guise of a minstrel, and seek healing at the
hands of the queen, although he knew that Gurmun had sworn to
kill him and every Cornishman who had the misfortune to fall into
his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length he reached the Irish court, and there he played and
sang so beautifully that the queen sent for him, and begged him to
teach his art to her young daughter Isolde. The minstrel found
the princess an attentive pupil; and while teaching her, and listening
to her sweet voice as she sang some plaintive ditty, he would
even forget for a time the pain of his wound. And she, in learning
from him, learnt to love him with all the strength of her innocent
young heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The days went on, and the pain of his wound grew worse and
worse. Then he told the queen of his suffering, and asked her
to heal him. This she at once consented to do, and a few weeks
later he was cured. He now sang with greater power than before,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_468' id='Page_468'>468</a></span>
and the king was so charmed with his music that he would have
liked to keep him for ever at his court. But, fearful of discovery,
Tristram determined to be gone while yet there was time.</p>

<p class='c007'>On his return to Cornwall, he was joyfully received by all except
the great lords, who foresaw that King Mark would make him his
heir, and they did not wish to have a foreigner to rule over them.
They wished the king to marry, and Tristram, finding what was in
their minds, himself advised his uncle to choose a wife, saying that
the Princess Isolde of Ireland would be the most suitable person
for him to wed. After some deliberation, it was agreed that
Tristram should go to King Gurmun as his uncle’s ambassador,
to ask for the hand of the princess.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived in Ireland, he set out for the royal residence. On the
way he heard heralds proclaiming that the king would give his
daughter in marriage to whoever slew a dragon that was devastating
the land, provided he who rescued the country were of noble
birth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tristram sought out the dragon, and, after a long struggle, killed
it; then cutting out the tongue of the creature, as a proof that he
had really slain it, he turned to go; but the pestiferous breath of
the monster so overpowered him, that he sank backward into the
morass out of which the dragon had come.</p>

<p class='c007'>Struggle as he might, he could not free himself, for he had sunk
up to the shoulders. While in this miserable plight, he saw a
horseman approach, cut off the head of the dead monster, and
then ride away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horseman was sewer (head waiter) at the palace. He showed
the king the dragon’s head, and boldly demanded the meed of
victory. The queen, who knew the man well, and held him to be
a coward, did not believe his tale; so she went with her train to
the dragon’s hole, and discovered the real hero in the morass. His
bloody sword, and the dragons tongue showed that it was he who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_469' id='Page_469'>469</a></span>
had done the deed. He was quite insensible when he was taken
out of the morass and carried to the palace. The princess at once
recognised him to be the minstrel who had before visited Ireland,
and hoped that his birth was sufficiently good to enable him to
win the prize. The queen gave him a sleeping potion, and told
him to keep quiet. Then taking her daughter into the next
room, she showed her the horrible tongue of the lind-worm, and
the sword with which the creature was slain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look,” she said, “the minstrel is the real hero of this adventure,
and not that cowardly sewer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She left the room, adding that the truth would soon be known.
Isolde took up the sword and examined it. She saw that a bit of
the blade was broken off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merciful heaven,” she cried, “surely he cannot be the——”
She ceased, and took from a drawer the splinter of steel she had
drawn out of the wound on her uncle’s head. She fitted the
splinter to the blade, and saw that it was as she had feared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha,” she went on, trembling with anger, “he is the murderer of
my uncle Morolt. He must die, die by my hand, and be slain
with his own weapon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Seizing the sword in a firmer grip, she went into the room where
Tristram was sleeping, and swung the sword over his head; but
as she did so, he smiled as in a happy dream, and she could not
do the deed. Then it seemed to her that she saw her uncle
looking at her reproachfully, and she nerved her heart to strike,
but at that moment her hand was seized by her mother, who had
entered unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wretched child,” she cried, “what are you doing? Are you
mad?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Isolde told the queen that this was Tristram, her uncle’s
murderer; and the mother answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I loved my brother dearly, but I cannot revenge him, for this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_470' id='Page_470'>470</a></span>
man has saved our people from the dragon, and a nation is worth
more than a single man, however dear to our hearts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Isolde confessed that her mother was right, and let her resentment
die.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Tristram had recovered, he did not show the dragon’s
tongue in proof of what he had done, but challenged the sewer
to trial by combat. Now the man had often fought before, but
when he saw Tristram come forth to meet him in the lists, his
heart died within him, and he confessed his guilt. King Gurmun
thereupon ordered the recreant knight’s shield to be broken, and
sent him forth a banished man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tristram then fetched the dragon’s tongue, and was at once
proclaimed victor amid the acclamation of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great was the astonishment of all, when Tristram, instead of
claiming the princess’ hand, proceeded to woo her for his uncle
King Mark, of Cornwall. Gurmun had such a dislike to King
Mark that he would have refused him as a son-in-law point-blank,
if Queen Isolde had not taken part in the debate, and shown the
wisdom of giving way. So Tristram received a gracious answer
from the king, and was content. No one thought of asking the
maiden if she were willing to marry the old king of Cornwall.
She was a princess, and princesses were never allowed a choice,
when reasons of State demanded that they should marry some
particular person.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Love-potion.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The princess went on board Tristram’s vessel, which was about
to sail for Cornwall. Her dresses and jewels were there also, and
as soon as her old nurse and faithful companion came down to the
ship, they were to set sail. Brangäne was closeted with the queen,
who wished to say a few last words in private.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, Brangäne,” said the mother, “take this goblet, and keep
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_471' id='Page_471'>471</a></span>
it carefully. It contains a drink made of the expressed juices of
certain plants, and is a love-potion. See that my daughter and
her husband both drink it on their marriage day, and all will yet
be well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The nurse promised to be careful, and took leave of the queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wind and weather were favourable to the voyagers. One day
when Tristram had been singing and playing to the princess for
a long time, and trying his best to distract her thoughts from
dwelling on her dead uncle, her old home, and the unknown future,
he became so thirsty that before beginning another song he was
fain to ask for something to drink. One of the attendants opened
a cupboard, and finding there a goblet with a drink all ready
prepared, supposed that the nurse had made it in case it were
wanted, and took it to Tristram, who handed the cup first to
Isolde that she might pledge him, as was the custom. The
princess raised the cup to her lips and drank a little; but finding
it very good, she put it to her lips again, and drank half the
contents. Then she returned it to Tristram, who finished it at
a draught.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their eyes met, and they knew that they loved each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Brangäne came in a few minutes later, and saw the empty
goblet upon the table, she burst into tears, and bemoaned what had
occurred, saying that the queen had given her the love-potion
to administer to Isolde and King Mark upon their wedding-day.
But the princess comforted her by asserting that no harm was
done, for human beings had free will, and could struggle against
enchantment. And struggle they did; but their love was strong.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ship reached the harbour, and King Mark came down to
meet his nephew and his bride. He was much pleased with the
appearance of the princess, whom he welcomed with all ceremony.
The marriage took place, and King Mark thought himself a happy
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_472' id='Page_472'>472</a></span>
All went on quietly for some time, so carefully did the nurse
conceal her lady’s love for Sir Tristram; but after a time people
began to whisper, and at length the whisper reached the ears of
the king. At first he would not believe the truth of what he
heard, but afterwards the thing was proved to him so clearly that
he could no longer doubt. He determined to bring the lovers to
trial. Meanwhile Brangäne had discovered that the king knew
all; she therefore warned Tristram, and fled into the forest with
him and Isolde. There they hid themselves in a cave for a long
time. But winter was coming on, and the nurse feared for her
darling’s life if she remained in such a place during the frost and
snow.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day as they were talking over what were best to be done,
King Mark suddenly appeared amongst them. Brangäne stepped
forward, and assured him that the stories that he had been told
were all gossip; and the king, who loved both Tristram and
Isolde, willingly believed her, and took them home with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the effect of the philter had not yet passed off, nor had the
young people conquered their love. Whispers again arose about
the court, and Tristram could not call any of the whisperers to
account, for he knew that he had dishonoured the name of knight,
and had ill repaid his uncle’s kindness. Isolde, too, was miserable.
They both made up their minds that they must part, and as they
said farewell, it was with the fervent hope that the magic potion
would have lost its power by the time they met again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tristram went away. He wandered through Normandy and
Alemannia; he fought many battles, and led a bold, adventurous
life, but he could not forget Isolde. At last he came to the
kingdom of Arundel, and there he found King Jovelin and his son
Kaedin hiding in a thatched cottage in a great forest, from the
bands of robbers who had overrun the land. It was late in
the evening when he arrived at the solitary house, where he met
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_473' id='Page_473'>473</a></span>
with a kind reception. The lovely daughter of his host, curiously
enough, was also named Isolde, to which was added the appellation
of “la blanche mains.” It did him good to be with the maiden
and her father. He promised them his aid, and for this purpose
went to visit his own kingdom. There he found his presence
much wanted, for old Rual was dead, and all was confusion in
the land. His first action was to re-establish order and good
government, after which he called out his troops, and marched
to Arundel to help King Jovelin. He fought the robbers there,
chased them out of the land, replaced the king on his throne, and
made friends with Kaedin. Weeks passed, and he became engaged
to Isolde of the white hand. He vainly hoped that being
married to another woman would cure him of his love for the
Queen of Cornwall, and he knew that the princess loved him.</p>

<p class='c007'>His betrothal did not bring him peace. His affection for the
Lady Isolde grew no stronger, so in despair he put off his
marriage, and, unable to feign a love he did not feel, went out
to seek death at the hands of the robber hordes that had again
invaded the country. He conquered them, and forced them to fly.
On his return from this expedition, his marriage day was fixed;
but one evening he was induced to accompany his friend Kaedin
on a dangerous adventure, and during the combat to which this led,
he received a spear thrust in the breast. He fell senseless to the
ground. Kaedin carried him out of the fight, and took him home
to the palace, where Isolde succeeded in bringing him to himself
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one hoped that he would soon recover from his wound;
but instead of that he grew worse. One day he said that the
Queen of Cornwall had a remedy that would cure him, if she
could only be induced to bring it. Kaedin at once set off for
Cornwall to appeal to her compassion. No sooner had the queen
heard his tale than she persuaded King Mark to let her go to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_474' id='Page_474'>474</a></span>
Arundel, and cure his nephew. Armed with his permission, she
started on her long journey by sea and land, and never rested
till she arrived at King Jovelin’s palace. There she was greeted
with the sad words, “You have come too late—he is dying.”
They led her to his couch, and she knelt down and took his
hand. A slight pressure showed that he knew who she was;
next moment he opened his eyes, gazed at her with a sad and
loving look, and then died. She bent over him and kissed him,
and in that kiss her spirit passed away. They were buried three
days later under the same grave-mound in the distant land of
Arundel.</p>

  <h2 id='p3c3' class='c005'><i>LEGEND OF TANNHÄUSER.</i></h2>
</div>

<h3 id='p3c3s1' class='c020'><span class='sc'>Tannhäuser in Trouble.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa c021'    >One evening when the noble knight Tannhäuser was
sitting in a miserable wayside inn, grumbling over the
fate that had made him a poor man instead of a prince, he was
startled by a loud knocking at the door. He felt a moment’s
terror lest it should be the bailiffs come to arrest him for debt;
but instead of that, it was his good lord, Duke Friedrich of
Babenberg, who ruled the rich Danubian land of Austria.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_476' id='Page_476'>476</a></span>
The duke chid the young man for his debts and follies, and
then, giving him a purse full of gold, desired him to return to
court, where his music and society were much missed.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Tannhäuser once more returned to court, and took part in
the gay doings there. He also aided his liege lord in many a
great battle waged against the enemies of the realm. He was
a great favourite of his master, both because of his gift of song,
and because of his bravery. So Friedrich gave him the fair
estate of Leopoldsdorf, near Vienna, as well as a large sum of
money.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hohenstaufens, too, looked upon him favourably, both the
Emperor Frederick II., and his son Konrad, who ruled in
Germany after him. The minstrel received many gifts at their
hands, and was devoted to their service.</p>

<p class='c007'>But although large sums were thus continually passing into his
coffers, he was always in debt. In course of time his patron the
Duke was killed in the battle of the Leitha. He mourned him
deeply, and wrote a number of beautiful songs in memory of the
man who had been so kind to him. But at length his poetic soul
began to turn with more pleasure to cheerful themes, so he collected
what little remained of his wealth, and, setting out in the bright
summer days, he wandered from castle to castle, and from town
to town, sometimes hungry, sometimes happy, as he was ill or
well received. He travelled through Bavaria, and remained some
time at Nürnberg, where song was loved and studied; and after
that he crossed the Alps into Italy. At Pavia, he made the
acquaintance of a German knight, who was much drawn to the fascinating
minne-singer, and he, in his turn, to the knight’s fair
daughter, Kunigunde. The old knight, on being asked for his
daughter’s hand, replied that he liked Tannhäuser very much, and
would give him his daughter willingly if he had the wherewithal
to support her. Minstrelsy was all very well, he added, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_477' id='Page_477'>477</a></span>
would not keep a family in bread and butter. “You have both
your sword and your harp to trust to,” he concluded with a smile;
“go, and make enough money to set up house, and then I will
give you Kunigunde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tannhäuser took leave of his lady-love, promising to return in
a year with the needful ducats; and he fully intended to keep his
promise.</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Klingsohr and Trusty Eckhard.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>He rode away sad at heart; but the weather was so beautiful,
and the birds were singing so gaily, that he could not remain sad
long. He sang wherever he could get an audience, but sweet
and joyous as was the music he made, it brought him no gold.
He therefore tried what his sword could do for him, and fought
under the banner of King Konrad, against his rival Heinrich
Raspe, the “pope’s king,” thereby helping to win the battle of
Ulm. He was handsomely rewarded for his assistance. Then he
went back to Italy, and fought there also for the Hohenstaufens,
for which service he was richly paid. Once, soon after this, he
sought and found shelter for the night in a castle where many
knights were assembled. After supper he delighted every one
with his minstrelsy. But immediately after he had ceased to
sing, a stranger came in, dressed in black garments embroidered
with gold, and wearing black feathers in his cap. He had a harp
in his hand, and, seating himself, began to play and sing in a
deep, powerful, and yet melodious, voice. His song was strange
and eerie in its effect. The guests all glanced at each other in
silence when it was done. They felt ill at ease, they knew not
why.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tannhäuser, throwing off the unaccountable feeling that
possessed him, caught up his harp, and sang a merry ditty about
woods and birds and flowers, and soon both he and the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_478' id='Page_478'>478</a></span>
guests were restored to their usual cheerfulness. After that, they
all began to play at dice. Tannhäuser won large sums, and lost
them again immediately to the black stranger, and not only these,
but some of the money he had put aside for his marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day, when he left the castle, the stranger went with
him, remained with him all day, and before night fell, had won all
his money from him. Seeing how sad Tannhäuser looked, the
stranger laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not pull such a long face over so small a matter as the
loss of a few gold pieces, but come with me to Wartburg;
Landgrave Hermann has summoned a minstrel tournament to
meet, in which the prizes are lands and wealth, but he who fails
will lose his head. My name is Klingsohr, and I come from
Hungary. I am willing to enter into an alliance with you. Your
songs are like the bliss of heaven; mine, like the horrors of hell.
If we are successful, you may have the wealth—I shall take the
heads; if, on the other hand, we lose, we shall go together to
heaven or hell; what does it matter which? You shudder like
a weakling to hear me talk thus, for you believe the tales the
priests tell you about fire and brimstone; but instead of that, it
is the realm of Dame Venus, who gives her friends the most
exquisite pleasures earth can afford, and both silver and gold
in abundance. If you do not care for the minstrel tournament,
you can visit the fair queen on the road to Wartburg, for she lives
in the Hörselberg, which we shall have to pass at any rate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tannhäuser listened to his companion with a shudder; but
when he went on to describe the unspeakable glories of the
Hörselberg, and to tell of the marvellous charms of the queen,
he felt a growing desire to see Dame Venus with his own eyes.
So he set out with his strange companion, forgetting, or nearly
forgetting, Kunigunde, and his love for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the travellers approached the mountains of Thuringia
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_479' id='Page_479'>479</a></span>
they were joined by a tall and stately man in full armour,
with his sword at his side, and a white staff in his hand.
As they walked on together, they exchanged confidences as to
who they were, and from whence they came. The new-comer
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“People call me the faithful Eckhard, the Harlungs’ comfort,
for I took care of the noble youths for many years; but, alas!
wicked Ermenrich, and his evil counsellor Sibich, slew them
in my absence, and all I could do was to avenge their death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Harlungs, Ermenrich, Sibich,” repeated Tannhäuser
thoughtfully, “it must have been long ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Three or four hundred years or even more may have passed
since then,” answered Eckhard. “I find it difficult to reckon
time after the manner of men; but ever since those old days
I have been busily employed in warning people away from
the Venus Mount.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Klingsohr burst out laughing, and cried, “Spare your words,
old fool; so you are one of the idiots who blaspheme Dame
Venus.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get thee behind me, tempter,” said Eckhard; “I am going
to take the good knight to the Wartburg, where he may win
glory and wealth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I am going on to prepare his lodging in our queen’s
palace,” answered the other, as he set off at a brisk pace towards
the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The minstrel and Eckhard continued their way quietly, talking
the while. At last they came to the beautiful Hörselthal, with
its meadows, trees, and rushing stream, and, a little farther on,
to a bleak mountain, out of which came a confused sound as
of waves beating a rock-bound coast, the roar and clatter of
a water-mill, human cries of rage, and the howling of wild
beasts.</p>

<p class='c007'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_480' id='Page_480'>480</a></span>
“That is the Hörselberg,” said Eckhard, “the place where
Dame Venus holds her court, with the wicked who are under
her dominion. Keep thine eyes and ears both shut, lest the
temptress entangle thee in her net.”</p>

<div class='c018'><span class='sc'>Dame Venus.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The nearer the travellers came to the mountain, the more
the confused and discordant sounds they had at first heard
resolved themselves into harmony. Through a door in the
rock they could see knights, beautiful women, and dwarfs. All
seemed to be enjoying themselves to the utmost. At the entrance
sat a fair woman in royal robes. The moment she saw Tannhäuser,
she smiled, and signed to him to approach. Eckhard
in the same moment entreated him by all he held sacred to
beware of the temptress, who was outwardly like an angel of
light, but inwardly a fiend incarnate. He would have said more,
but Venus interrupted him by beginning to sing a wondrous
song about all the joys that awaited those who entered her
kingdom; and Tannhäuser, as thoroughly enchanted as though
a magic spell had been cast over him, thrust Eckhard aside,
and hastened to the queen of beauty, who stretched out her
arms towards him. She half drew him over the threshold, and
he half staggered across. Then the door shut, and the faithful
Eckhard saw him no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be impossible to describe all the wonders and delights
that greeted the eyes and ears of the lost knight. Every day
brought new pleasures, which he enjoyed to the utmost. But
at length he began to tire of it, and confessed to himself that
satiety was not happiness. He had a horror of himself, and
of the self-indulgent life he was leading; and his conscience,
once awake, left him no peace. After an inward struggle, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_481' id='Page_481'>481</a></span>
made up his mind to go and seek out a pious priest, tell him
all, and entreat him to show him how he might gain absolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tannhäuser felt much happier when he had formed this resolution.
He went to Queen Venus, and asked her to let him
go. At first she refused, and then consented, saying that he
might come back to her if he did not find what he was going
away to seek. So he went out into the sweet fresh air, which
was so pure that it almost took his breath away for the first
few minutes. Then he went on his way with much foreboding:
should he, or should he not, find a priest who could help him?</p>

<p class='c007'>He told his tale to priests, abbots, and bishops, but they
one and all declared that they could not help him, that the
Holy Father at Rome was the only person on earth who had
power to absolve a sinner who had had dealings with the powers
of the under-world.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went to Rome, and confessed all his sin and sorrow to
the Pope, whom he found walking in the garden, and awaited
the answer of his Holiness with a broken and a contrite heart.
But the Pope replied with harsh voice and unbending brow:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are an adherent of the cursed race of Hohenstaufen;
you have dwelt among the lost spirits in hell, and have been
one with them: I tell you plainly that God can no more
pardon you than this dry stick can put forth leaves and flowers”;
so saying, he thrust his gold-headed walking-stick into the ground,
and walked away leaving it there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tannhäuser then exclaimed in his misery, “What shall I do?
The high-priest of the Lord has cast me off, heaven is closed
against me, and men will have nought to do with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment an unknown voice broke in, “There is a
higher than this priest, even He whose dwelling is in heaven, and
He that came to redeem men from their sins, and who said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_482' id='Page_482'>482</a></span>
‘Come unto Me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and
I will give you rest.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tannhäuser started when he heard himself thus addressed, and,
turning round, beheld the faithful Eckhard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas,” he answered, “it is too late; I cannot, dare not, pray
any more. I will now return to Dame Venus, and the pleasures
she offers me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So he went back to the Hörselberg in spite of Eckhard’s
entreaties; for he was utterly hopeless.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it came to pass, three days after, that the Pope again
walked in his garden, and behold, the walking-stick which he
thrust into the ground had taken root, and put forth leaves
and blossoms. The sight filled him with amazement, and he
remembered the words of the Saviour: “Be ye also merciful,
even as your Father in heaven is merciful.” And he sent out
messengers in search of Tannhäuser; but he could not be found,
for he had returned to Dame Venus.</p>
